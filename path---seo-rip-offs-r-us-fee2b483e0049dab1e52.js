We get calls at <a href=\"http://www.theplancollection.com\">The Plan Collection</a> for these all the time.</p>\n<p>I need to setup one of these companies. They are usually run by a couple of jokers who know very little about SEO. In this case the jokers were looking for easy money. They wanted 10k for a 'keyword analysis' and 10k to optimize 10 pages. Holy Crap!</p>\n<p>The 'analysis' involved a bunch of people at the university running around coming up with the 'things they want to advertise' - read keywords. Not sure what that leaves for the SEO company to do. I guess they can type it up. Makes them a pretty dang expensive secretary. They then wanted to charge to setup an adwords campaign - you know because Google makes that process so hard.</p>\n<p>My tip?</p>\n<p>Start with <a href=\"http://www.seochat.com/\">SEOChat.com</a>. This site is a vibrant community of real SEO pros that will tell you all kinds of neat stuff for free. Work a little and save yourself the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://del.icio.us/jbasdf/seo\">In case anyone cares here are my SEO links on delicious</a>.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"SEO &#8211; rip offs-R-us",date:"June 18, 2007",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/seo-rip-offs-r-us"}}}});
