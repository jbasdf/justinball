I finally gave up, deleted everything MySQL related according to <a href=\"http://akrabat.com/computing/uninstalling-mysql-on-mac-os-x-leopard/\">these notes</a> and then I used homebrew to do a clean install.</p>\n<p>After the install I started getting this error:</p>\n<pre><code>ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I couldn't figure out what was going on so I checked my logs in /usr/local/var/mysql (in that directory find a file that ends in .err). Here's what I kept seeing over and over again:</p>\n<pre><code>110705 14:33:20 [ERROR] /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.12/bin/mysqld: unknown variable 'default-character-set=utf8'\n110705 14:33:20 [ERROR] Aborting\n</code></pre>\n<p>Turns out if you upgrade MySQL you'll want to modify /etc/my.cnf. This line causes problems:</p>\n<pre><code>default-character-set = utf8\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remove that and you should be good. For reference here's what my '/etc/my.cnf' file looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>[mysqld]\nmax_allowed_packet=64M\ncollation-server = utf8_unicode_ci\ninit-connect='SET NAMES utf8'\ncharacter-set-server = utf8\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a side note be sure to change max_allowed_packet to something like 64M. I was trying to restore a large database and MySQL kept barfing with this error:\nERROR 2006 (HY000) at line 682: MySQL server has gone away</p>\n<p>Turns out the default packet size is to small to restore all but the smallest databases.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Upgrade to MySQL 5.5.12 and now MySQL won&#8217;t start",date:"July 05, 2011",image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/upgrade-to-mysql-5-5-12-and-now-mysql-wont-start"}}}});
