<p>I got up at 5am this morning which is something I never do, but decided it would be worth the drive to Happy Valley to listen to local leaders in the Blockchain world.</p>

<h2>Blockchain: What is it and what can it do?</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanjohnson3/">Jonathan Johnson</a>, president of <a href="http://www.mediciventures.com/">Medici Ventures</a></h3>

<p>Fall of 2013 Johnson's son asked his dad when will Overstock.com start accepting Bitcoin? At the same Overstock's founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Byrne">Patrick Byrne</a> and on Jan 9, 2014 became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Blockchain will do for assets what the internet did for information. Where assets are stocks, titles, contracts or any kind of physical assets where you don't want a copy you want the original item.</p>

<p>Blockchain is technology that let's us trust each other when we don't know each other - "Trust through technology"</p>

<h4>Blockchain solutions to global poverty</h4>
<p>"It's expensive to be poor" - Babriel Abed, Bitt Founder</p>
<p>"Any who's been to a payday lender would say it's expensive to be poor" - John Johnson</p>

<p>2.5 billion globalized world citizens have access to offical ledgers. 5 billion of the world's un-globalized world citizens do not have access to a structured knowledge of property rights. That makes it difficult for those individuals to unlock they capital associated with that property for entreprenuership.</p>
