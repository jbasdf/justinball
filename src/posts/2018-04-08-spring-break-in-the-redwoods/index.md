  We took the kids on a 3000 mile road trip through Tahoe, Sonoma Valley and the Redwoods for spring break this year to see trees 50 feet in circumference that are older than most of civilization.
</p>
<p>
  The food in Northern California left plenty to be desired but our only real regret was missing Dick Taylor chocolate in Eureka California.
</p>
<p>
  There's quite a bit of distance between Logan, UT and Reno, NV. My wife as always was awesome and drove so that I could work in the car. The mobile wifi in the car worked through most of the trip but even the nicer antennas in the car could connect to the Internet while driving through north eastern Nevada.

  Family vacations tend to blur together. My brain blends all the days into one long event with only vague, sleepless nights to punctuate the days. I'm trying pictures to help deliniate. See below.
