  We took the kids on a 3000 mile road trip through Tahoe, Sonoma Valley and the Redwoods for spring break this year to see trees 50 feet in circumference that are older than most of civilization.


  The food in Northern California . Our only regret was missing Dick Taylor chocolate in Eureka California.
