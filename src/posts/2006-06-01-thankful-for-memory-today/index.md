On the way into work I was listening to 'The Infinite Mind' on NPR. It was a story about [Caris Corfman][1] an actress who lost her short term memory after surgery to remove a brain tumor. Her situation reminded me of the movie [ 50 first dates][2]. At the time I saw the movie I had no idea that the condition was even possible, but today I am thankful for the simple ability to remember.
