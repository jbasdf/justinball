After four days of kids, mosquitoes and me biking every day my wife is not going to divorce me so it's been a great vacation. Of course as I type this Callie is giving me grief that of all the things I write about it's the biking so stay tuned on the divorce front.</p>\\n<p>Actually, Callie is a great wife and very patient to let me get up, abandon her to get the kids ready and ride for a couple of hours each morning and once in the middle of the day. I'm not winning any father of the year awards but she might deserve sainthood. I owe her big time and so once again I offer to purchase her any bike she likes. (and we're going on vacation again this next week with her family and I'm planning on taking the bikes so I need points).</p>\\n<p>It's amazing how hard it is to find a place to ride. I keep thinking that the Internet is an omnipotent source of all truth and knowledge, but there's not much online about riding in Teton Valley. I knew there was a bike path since I'd seen it before and my dad was a part of that project, but other than that it's hard to tune into the local biking scene unless you are a local. (It's the same everywhere I go). I finally found some maps hidden on <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/\\\">Teton Valley Trails and Pathways</a>. They're stowed away under <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/resources/maps\\\">resources -> maps</a>. The one I found most useful is the <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP Cycling Map</a> which listed a couple of rides that looked like they made sense..</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.vrbo.com/331221\\\">We stayed at a great cabin in the middle of the valley just a few miles north of Victor</a>. Since it wasn't far from the bike path that goes from Victor to Driggs I was able to utilize that path the first day and do \\\"The Loop\\\" - a 25 mile loop around the main part of the valley. I normally avoid bike paths when riding at higher speeds since slamming into a pedestrian makes them really mad and there's really not much glory in passing a 5 year old on his BMX. However, in Teton Valley early in the morning the bike path is relatively vacant, and you want to avoid the section of highway it parallels unless you have a lot of life insurance. Between the tourists gawking at the scenery, the locals treating it like the autobahn and the fact there is no shoulder your likely hood of early death.</p>\\n<p>This year the water is high all over the inter-mountain west. We've had plenty of flooding in Cache Valley and Teton Valley has seen similar issues. The entire valley floor is pretty much a giant swamp that collects the run off from the surrounding hills. I was glad for my cross bike on day one while doing the loop since the bike path had become a channel for one of the local creeks. The road across the valley from east to west had low traffic and was fast. I did have to stop to take a picture of a bald eagle: . The <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP cycling map</a> mentions that the west side of the loop has a 2 mile section of gravel road that's not a big deal. I'm sure if you don't love your road bike you can ride it just fine, but I'm pretty fond of my carbon wheels and the paint on my road bike so again the cross bike was a great choice for \\\"The Loop\\\". I cut the ride a bit short and came back across on North Cedron road which is the road where the cabin was. It's downhill from the main road so was able to hit it going 24 plus MPH which was fun until I hit a section of the road where for some reason they decided to dump the remains of a stone quarry. I nearly wiped out when the gravel turned to 3-4\\\" rocks. Callie doesn't like it when I go to the hospital so I dropped my pace and did some swearing. The next section of road was under water, but being a man and all I couldn't let that stop me. I was actually surprised when it didn't and saddened that no one was around to see it. The creek there had cut a channel across the road that was a foot deep which buried the bottom half of my bike in liquid. I'm guessing that's why my power meter doesn't work anymore.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.88429752066116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0609\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg 1936w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>I slept in the next day and so decided I would just do a quick up and down the bike path. It ended up being about 20 miles and I totally left several bmx riding 5 year olds and a couple of old people in the dust. The bike path trip was actually to scout out places to park in Driggs so I could ride Ski Hill road. It felt pretty wussy to drive 8 miles so I could ride my bike, but surprisingly the point of a family trip isn't to avoid the family so I had to keep my rides short. I also checked out the local bike shop <a href=\\\"http://www.peakedsports.com/Home.html\\\">Peaked Sports</a> - sort of anyway. I rode by. I have a history of racking up grounds for divorce credit card bills at bike shops so I thought it best that I look from a distance. They rent bikes so if you don't bring your own you can still ride. Personally I prefer to bring my own stuff. It feels weird to play with other people's equipment.</p>\\n<p>I saved Ski Hill road up to Grand Targee for the last day. After that ride I'm totally ready to buy one of the foreclosed cabins and spend the rest of my days just riding up and down the mountain.

A big thanks to <a href=\\\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/advisoryboard/detail.cfm?mem=1110&#x26;group=3&#x26;pid=822\\\">John Pestana</a> for hosting the first party of the BoomStartup program. I can imagine it's a bit stressful to invite 20-30 strangers to your very nice home.</p>\\n<p>I had a great time talking with fellow founders and the mentors and getting a better idea of what they are working on. One conversation stands out in particular. I had a chance to discuss business development and entrepreneurship with <a href=\\\"http://www.johnrichards.me/\\\">John Richards</a>. Our discussion revolved around how entrepreneurs in the technology space create innovative products that result in good paying jobs and how it's important for cities, counties and states to encourage that type of development. Unfortunately, it's all to often easy to try and bring in another Walmart or Home Depot (with their poor wages and lousy benefits) because they bring in immediate revenue via sales taxes.</p>\\n<p>I had a great chance to talk Lego and toy trains with John Pestana. I had assumed he was starting <a href=\\\"http://www.exactrail.com/\\\">ExactRail</a> because once you've hit a home run like Omniture you can do whatever you like and why not build a company aligned with a favorite hobby? I was wrong. Sort of. John likes trains, but his vision for that company in the space is extraordinary and will likely revolutionize how the industry builds and markets trains.</p>\\n<p>The energy in the room was exciting. Everyone there was optimistic about the future and clearly believes that their idea will revolutionize their space. It's fun to hang out in an atmosphere like that.</p>\\n<p>I contrast that with <a href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/05/13/136274980/how-to-create-a-job\\\">a story I heard listening to NPR</a> on the way back to Salt Lake. It was a series of interviews with politicians, business owners, business development organizations and employees. In one of the interviews 5 candidates were interviewed at the same time to determine whether or not they were worthy to make $10/hr (with benefits) to work in a call center. The job sounded terrible. They monitor your every move. If you go to the bathroom you clock out. If you have any down time them how will you fill it to benefit the company. Basically, can we program you and turn you into a human regurgitation machine since customers prefer to talk to a live body. I sensed all creatively being drained from each of this individuals all so they could earn 20k per year.</p>\\n<p>That's not the kind of job growth I envision for this country.</p>\\n<p>Another set of interviews occurred at a business development conference which the interviewer described as a bunch of cordial thieves. Basically, if you are an economic development officer, your job is to lure companies into your area. You usually do this through a combination of sales pitch (our people are awesome) and tax breaks. The only problem with this process is that there are no net jobs created. Once place simple steals jobs from another place.</p>\\n<p>That reminded me of a <a href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/14/startups-or-behemoths-which-are-we-going-to-bet-on/\\\">TechCrunch article from a while back that asked the simple question: who's responsible for job growth, startups or big business</a>? Not surprisingly, according to a <a href=\\\"http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedFiles/firm-formation-inception-8-2-10.pdf\\\">study from the Kauffman foundation</a> the net job creation in this country comes from startups. Big business moves jobs around to take advantage of better tax breaks, etc, but overall they don't really generate a lot of new jobs. That begs the question, why do all of these economic development offices put so much of our tax money into luring companies when they should instead focus on the talent they already have, nurture it, and build new opportunities - the 100k per year jobs instead of the 20k call center sweat shops?</p>\\n<p>I think programs like BoomStartup and similar programs throughout the country focus on what they economic development offices have missed. It's true that not all the companies coming out of these incubator programs will turn into the next Twitter or Facebook. Some may fail. However, many will turn into impressive corporations that contribute significantly to the economy. I look forward to finding out which kind we'll be. My bet is that we'll be one of the success stories.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-05-14-boomstartup-opening-social/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/boomstartup-opening-social\",\"date\":\"2011-05-14T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"BoomStartup Opening Social\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"We've been building OER Glue since this last July and the result is a piece of technology that when people see it they have the same reaction they have during a magic show - HOLY SH@#$ how do you do that?

It turns out that there are others that have had this problem. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652763/jquery-object-to-string\\\">Here's the solution on stackoverflow.com</a>.  <a href=\\\"http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8142#comment:5\\\">There's a request for the jQuery team to implement an outerHtml() method</a>. Go add a comment and push the request, please.</p>\\n<p>I was using the solution from stackoverflow and it worked well until one day all of the contents of my page vanished upon execution of a method leaving me with a serious WTF at 1 am in the morning.</p>\\n<p>Here's part of my code. I've found that for manipulating an html string jQuery is the bomb. In the code below I take a snippet of html, remove whitespace and then rewrite links.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\tclean_snippet: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/'/gi, \\\"&#40;\\\"); // single quote will cause javascript problems inline.\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/[\\\\t\\\\n\\\\r]/gi, \\\"\\\"); // remove tabs, newlines, and return chars\\n\\t\\treturn this.rewrite_links(snippet);\\n\\t},\\n\\n\\t// Rewrite links in the snippets so they go back to the parent site.\\n\\trewrite_links: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tvar obj = jQuery(snippet);\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[href]').attr('href', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.href); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[src]').attr('src', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.src); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[action]').attr('action', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.action); });\\n\\t\\treturn com.oerglue.common.obj_to_s(obj);\\n\\t},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>(Note this code won't work standalone there are some missing methods. It's just here for illustration).</p>\\n<p>When I'm done rewriting links in the html snippet I think convert the jQuery object back into html. I originally used a derivative of the code from the StackOverFlow conversation:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nobj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n  jQuery('< div>').append(obj.clone()).remove().html();\\n},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That works until obj contains script tags which it frequently does when you are dealing with arbitrary html. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610995/jquery-cant-append-script-element\\\">It turns out that 'append' and all other similar jQuery methods are smart about how they append data and they know to look for script tags</a>.  Because of that when I was appending the object the scripts from the page I'm operating on are re-executed which causes all kinds of nasty problems - see how many web pages can handle the re-execution of bits of javascript from the page. In most cases jQuery is doing what you want. Most of the time when adding new stuff you want the scripts to run. However, when you are building a string you don't want the code to run rather you just want a string representation of the code.</p>\\n<p>I've rewritten my obj<em>to</em>s code to look like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n  obj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n\\t\\tvar tmp = jQuery('<div>');\\n\\t\\tjQuery.each(obj, function(index, item){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(!jQuery.nodeName(item, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp.append(item);\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\treturn tmp.html();\\n  },\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I currently ignore scripts when I do the append and now I get a string. I'll post an update when I have a solution for appending the script text.</p>\\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\\n<p>Thanks goes to <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/ryankshaw\\\">Ryan Shaw</a> for helping me work through this. The code below extends jQuery to include an outerHtml method and provides a way to include or exclude scripts.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\njQuery.fn.outerHtml = function(include_scripts) {\\n\\tif(include_scripts === undefined){ include_scripts = false; }\\n\\tvar clone = this.clone();\\n\\tvar items = jQuery.map(clone, function(element){\\n\\t\\tif(jQuery.nodeName(element, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(include_scripts){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvar attributes;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif(element.attributes){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tattributes = jQuery.map(element.attributes, function(attribute){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    return attribute.name + '=\\\"' + attribute.value + '\\\" ';\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  });\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn '<' + element.nodeName + ' ' + attributes.join(' ') + \\\">\\\" + jQuery(element).html() + \\\"</\\\" + element.nodeName +'>';\\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn '';\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jQuery('<div>').append(element).remove().html();\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t});\\n\\treturn items.join('');\\n}\\n\\n</pre></code>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/817477\\\">Here's the gist on github</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-02-08-converting-a-jquery-object-into-a-string/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/converting-a-jquery-object-into-a-string\",\"date\":\"2011-02-08T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Converting a jQuery Object into a String\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I love to ride and I have a serious addiction to the gear that I use when I ride.

For the most part the change consists of deleting all the code you used to hack into the Rails framework and adding subclass of '::Rails::Engine'. I'll try to put together a detailed post explaining Rails 3 engines later.</p>\\n<p>The nice thing about having a test suite in place is that you can rely on those tests to ensure the upgrade is smooth. I've always written my tests in <a href=\\\"http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda\\\">Shoulda</a>. I like the syntax and I love the macros. However, I'm switching everything over to RSpec. <a href=\\\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/731871832/this-should-change-your-mind\\\">Thoughtbot has declared they won't abandon the Shoulda community, but since they've made the switch to RSpec for new projects it's pretty clear that Shoulda as a stand alone project has a limited life.</a></p>\\n<p>Luckily I've used RSpec in a lot of other projects and it's an easy DSL to like. The conversion from shoulda to RSpec isn't a terribly difficult one. You basically need to replace \\\"context\\\" with describe and then remove your assert statements and replace then with 'should'.</p>\\n<p>One of the most difficult issues I've had to deal with is my custom shoulda macros. From what I've read the move to BDD should inspire you to use fewer macros and instead focus on specific behavior. I think that philosophy is great, but I've already got a lot of code that uses the macros and so the macros need to be brought over. The change from shoulda macros to RSpec matchers is painful, but I think the code is cleaner and easier to read.</p>\\n<p>For example, I have custom scope macros. Here's the shoulda macro:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n  # Test for 'by_title' named scope which orders by title:\\n  # scope :by_title, :order => \\\"title ASC\\\"\\n  # requires that the class have a shoulda factory\\n  def should_scope_by_title\\n    klass = get_klass\\n    factory_name = name_for_factory(klass)\\n    context \\\"'by_title' title scope\\\" do\\n      setup do\\n        klass.delete_all\\n        @first = Factory(factory_name, :title => 'a')\\n        @second = Factory(factory_name, :title => 'b')\\n      end\\n      should \\\"sort by name\\\" do\\n        assert_equal @first, klass.by_title[0]\\n        assert_equal @second, klass.by_title[1]\\n      end\\n    end\\n  end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>And here's the RSpec matcher:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n# Ensures that the model can sort by_title\\n# requires that the class have a factory\\n#\\n# Tests scope:\\n#   scope :by_title, :order => \\\"title ASC\\\"\\n#\\n# Examples:\\n#   it { should scope_by_title }\\n#\\ndef scope_by_title\\n  SortingMatcher.new(:by_title, :title)\\nend\\n\\nclass SortingMatcher # :nodoc:\\n\\n  def initialize(scope, field)\\n    @scope = scope\\n    @field = field\\n  end\\n\\n  def matches?(subject)\\n    @subject = subject\\n    @subject.class.delete_all\\n    @first = Factory(factory_name, @field => 'a')\\n    @second = Factory(factory_name, @field => 'b')\\n    @first == @subject.class.send(@scope)[0] && @second == @subject.class.send(@scope)[1]\\n  end\\n\\n  def failure_message\\n    \\\"Expected #{factory_name} to scope by #{@scope} on #{@field}\\\"\\n  end\\n\\n  def description\\n    \\\"sort by title\\\"\\n  end\\n\\n  private\\n\\n    def factory_name\\n      @subject.class.name.underscore.to_sym\\n    end\\n\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I don't profess to be a master of either but my tests work so hopefully this helps someone if you're making the same transition.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-09-18-shoulda-used-rspec/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/shoulda-used-rspec\",\"date\":\"2010-09-18T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Shoulda used RSpec\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been trying to get  Uploadify  to work inside my <a href=\\\" http://github.com/jbasdf/uploader\\\"Uploadify>uploader  gem .

There's a number of solutions that people have come up with, but mostly they sound like voodoo - Be sure to only return a '1', make sure to use an id instead of a css class, etc. I tried everything I read about and finally got mad enough to debug the fla file. </p>\\n<p>If you are that desperate make sure to get <a href=\\\"http://www.actionscript-flash-guru.com/blog/21-fireflash-firebug-console-for-flash\\\">FireFlash</a>. It will let you write to the Firebug console from within your swf file. It's very handy when you need to see what's going on inside your Actionscript while running inside the browser. I created a debug version of the fla that output the events that the swf file was attempting to fire on the client.  If you want to try it out in hopes it will help you debug <a href='http://www.justinball.comUploadify.zip'>download a zip file with the swf and fla</a>.</p>\\n<p>OK so now to the point. What's going wrong? Why doesn't 'onComplete' fire? The answer is that Uploadify binds events to the DOM item you specify via jQuery('#my-upload-container').uploadify(); These events include 'uploadifySelect', 'uploadifyOpen', 'uploadifyProgress', 'uploadifyComplete', etc. What I found is that the swf makes a call that looks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nExternalInterface.call(['jQuery'+p(q('#'+param.uploadifyID)), p(list.join(','))].join('.trigger'));\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That call does it's job - I can watch it make the ExternalInterface calls using FireFlash. The swf file attempts to trigger the events I listed above that have been bound to the element identified by id=\\\"my-upload-container\\\". However, something goes wrong and somehow the\\n'my-upload-container' element loses it's bindings and nothing is fired.</p>\\n<p>I found I can get things to work if I change 'jquery.uploadify.js' to bind the events above to the document instead of to the DOM element and then change the fla to do this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nExternalInterface.call(['jQuery(document)', p(list.join(','))].join('.trigger'));\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That means that the events do fire however it's a hack so I kept digging (and swearing) and I bummed some help off Joel.....</p>\\n<p>It turns out that the problem wasn't Flash. It wasn't uploadify. It wasn't jQuery although all of those components seemed like they might be the source of the problem.  The problem as it turns out was TinyMCE. (As it turns out TinyMCE is the source of a lot of my problems but I still like it).</p>\\n<p>In our specific case we've built a plugin to TinyMCE that let's you upload files to the server. (You can find it in the <a href=\\\"http://github.com/tatemae/muck-contents\\\">muck-contents gem</a>). We use the TinyMCE scripts to build our popups which means using 'tiny<em>mce/tiny</em>mce_popup.js'. If you look in that code very deeply you will discover this code around line 320:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n  if ((nv = t.editor.translate(h)) && nv != h)\\n    document.body.innerHTML = nv;\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Notice that the way the popup handles translations is to replace the entire document with new html. If you use jQuery and your bindings have already been setup you realize this is very bad because everything you've setup using the standard methods just vanished. (This goes for all methods - click, bind, etc. They will all go away).</p>\\n<p>ie This won't work:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\njQuery(document).ready(function(){\\n   jQuery('#mce_uploader_upload').uploadify(mce_uploader_options);\\n});\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>The solution is simple and probably obvious to a seasoned TinyMCE dev (which I'm not). Put your code into a different initialization block:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\ntinyMCEPopup.onInit.add(function(ed) {\\n   jQuery('#mce_uploader_upload').uploadify(mce_uploader_options);\\n});\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>As an aside I should mention that if you need help getting uploadify running in your Rails application there's already a couple of great tutorials.

After four days of kids, mosquitoes and me biking every day my wife is not going to divorce me so it's been a great vacation. Of course as I type this Callie is giving me grief that of all the things I write about it's the biking so stay tuned on the divorce front.</p>\\n<p>Actually, Callie is a great wife and very patient to let me get up, abandon her to get the kids ready and ride for a couple of hours each morning and once in the middle of the day. I'm not winning any father of the year awards but she might deserve sainthood. I owe her big time and so once again I offer to purchase her any bike she likes. (and we're going on vacation again this next week with her family and I'm planning on taking the bikes so I need points).</p>\\n<p>It's amazing how hard it is to find a place to ride. I keep thinking that the Internet is an omnipotent source of all truth and knowledge, but there's not much online about riding in Teton Valley. I knew there was a bike path since I'd seen it before and my dad was a part of that project, but other than that it's hard to tune into the local biking scene unless you are a local. (It's the same everywhere I go). I finally found some maps hidden on <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/\\\">Teton Valley Trails and Pathways</a>. They're stowed away under <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/resources/maps\\\">resources -> maps</a>. The one I found most useful is the <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP Cycling Map</a> which listed a couple of rides that looked like they made sense..</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.vrbo.com/331221\\\">We stayed at a great cabin in the middle of the valley just a few miles north of Victor</a>. Since it wasn't far from the bike path that goes from Victor to Driggs I was able to utilize that path the first day and do \\\"The Loop\\\" - a 25 mile loop around the main part of the valley. I normally avoid bike paths when riding at higher speeds since slamming into a pedestrian makes them really mad and there's really not much glory in passing a 5 year old on his BMX. However, in Teton Valley early in the morning the bike path is relatively vacant, and you want to avoid the section of highway it parallels unless you have a lot of life insurance. Between the tourists gawking at the scenery, the locals treating it like the autobahn and the fact there is no shoulder your likely hood of early death.</p>\\n<p>This year the water is high all over the inter-mountain west. We've had plenty of flooding in Cache Valley and Teton Valley has seen similar issues. The entire valley floor is pretty much a giant swamp that collects the run off from the surrounding hills. I was glad for my cross bike on day one while doing the loop since the bike path had become a channel for one of the local creeks. The road across the valley from east to west had low traffic and was fast. I did have to stop to take a picture of a bald eagle: . The <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP cycling map</a> mentions that the west side of the loop has a 2 mile section of gravel road that's not a big deal. I'm sure if you don't love your road bike you can ride it just fine, but I'm pretty fond of my carbon wheels and the paint on my road bike so again the cross bike was a great choice for \\\"The Loop\\\". I cut the ride a bit short and came back across on North Cedron road which is the road where the cabin was. It's downhill from the main road so was able to hit it going 24 plus MPH which was fun until I hit a section of the road where for some reason they decided to dump the remains of a stone quarry. I nearly wiped out when the gravel turned to 3-4\\\" rocks. Callie doesn't like it when I go to the hospital so I dropped my pace and did some swearing. The next section of road was under water, but being a man and all I couldn't let that stop me. I was actually surprised when it didn't and saddened that no one was around to see it. The creek there had cut a channel across the road that was a foot deep which buried the bottom half of my bike in liquid. I'm guessing that's why my power meter doesn't work anymore.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.88429752066116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0609\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg 1936w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>I slept in the next day and so decided I would just do a quick up and down the bike path. It ended up being about 20 miles and I totally left several bmx riding 5 year olds and a couple of old people in the dust. The bike path trip was actually to scout out places to park in Driggs so I could ride Ski Hill road. It felt pretty wussy to drive 8 miles so I could ride my bike, but surprisingly the point of a family trip isn't to avoid the family so I had to keep my rides short. I also checked out the local bike shop <a href=\\\"http://www.peakedsports.com/Home.html\\\">Peaked Sports</a> - sort of anyway. I rode by. I have a history of racking up grounds for divorce credit card bills at bike shops so I thought it best that I look from a distance. They rent bikes so if you don't bring your own you can still ride. Personally I prefer to bring my own stuff. It feels weird to play with other people's equipment.</p>\\n<p>I saved Ski Hill road up to Grand Targee for the last day. After that ride I'm totally ready to buy one of the foreclosed cabins and spend the rest of my days just riding up and down the mountain. This is what it looks like:\\n.\\nIf you are in town for one day do this ride. The pavement is smooth. The road ends at a ski resort so there's not a lot of traffic. The views are spectacular. I get the impression that this is the ride the locals do since I saw quite a few other bikers. I also saw a group of 3 skateboarders coming down the road. I think they were on a suicide mission.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-9c565.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 74.69135802469135%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0614\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-fd4ba.jpg 1950w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-9c565.jpg 2592w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>There are a few other rides I want to do but didn't have time.

A big thanks to <a href=\\\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/advisoryboard/detail.cfm?mem=1110&#x26;group=3&#x26;pid=822\\\">John Pestana</a> for hosting the first party of the BoomStartup program. I can imagine it's a bit stressful to invite 20-30 strangers to your very nice home.</p>\\n<p>I had a great time talking with fellow founders and the mentors and getting a better idea of what they are working on. One conversation stands out in particular. I had a chance to discuss business development and entrepreneurship with <a href=\\\"http://www.johnrichards.me/\\\">John Richards</a>. Our discussion revolved around how entrepreneurs in the technology space create innovative products that result in good paying jobs and how it's important for cities, counties and states to encourage that type of development. Unfortunately, it's all to often easy to try and bring in another Walmart or Home Depot (with their poor wages and lousy benefits) because they bring in immediate revenue via sales taxes.</p>\\n<p>I had a great chance to talk Lego and toy trains with John Pestana. I had assumed he was starting <a href=\\\"http://www.exactrail.com/\\\">ExactRail</a> because once you've hit a home run like Omniture you can do whatever you like and why not build a company aligned with a favorite hobby? I was wrong. Sort of. John likes trains, but his vision for that company in the space is extraordinary and will likely revolutionize how the industry builds and markets trains.</p>\\n<p>The energy in the room was exciting. Everyone there was optimistic about the future and clearly believes that their idea will revolutionize their space. It's fun to hang out in an atmosphere like that.</p>\\n<p>I contrast that with <a href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/05/13/136274980/how-to-create-a-job\\\">a story I heard listening to NPR</a> on the way back to Salt Lake. It was a series of interviews with politicians, business owners, business development organizations and employees. In one of the interviews 5 candidates were interviewed at the same time to determine whether or not they were worthy to make $10/hr (with benefits) to work in a call center. The job sounded terrible. They monitor your every move. If you go to the bathroom you clock out. If you have any down time them how will you fill it to benefit the company. Basically, can we program you and turn you into a human regurgitation machine since customers prefer to talk to a live body. I sensed all creatively being drained from each of this individuals all so they could earn 20k per year.</p>\\n<p>That's not the kind of job growth I envision for this country.</p>\\n<p>Another set of interviews occurred at a business development conference which the interviewer described as a bunch of cordial thieves. Basically, if you are an economic development officer, your job is to lure companies into your area. You usually do this through a combination of sales pitch (our people are awesome) and tax breaks. The only problem with this process is that there are no net jobs created. Once place simple steals jobs from another place.</p>\\n<p>That reminded me of a <a href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/14/startups-or-behemoths-which-are-we-going-to-bet-on/\\\">TechCrunch article from a while back that asked the simple question: who's responsible for job growth, startups or big business</a>? Not surprisingly, according to a <a href=\\\"http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedFiles/firm-formation-inception-8-2-10.pdf\\\">study from the Kauffman foundation</a> the net job creation in this country comes from startups. Big business moves jobs around to take advantage of better tax breaks, etc, but overall they don't really generate a lot of new jobs. That begs the question, why do all of these economic development offices put so much of our tax money into luring companies when they should instead focus on the talent they already have, nurture it, and build new opportunities - the 100k per year jobs instead of the 20k call center sweat shops?</p>\\n<p>I think programs like BoomStartup and similar programs throughout the country focus on what they economic development offices have missed. It's true that not all the companies coming out of these incubator programs will turn into the next Twitter or Facebook. Some may fail. However, many will turn into impressive corporations that contribute significantly to the economy. I look forward to finding out which kind we'll be.

Go add a comment and push the request, please.</p>\\n<p>I was using the solution from stackoverflow and it worked well until one day all of the contents of my page vanished upon execution of a method leaving me with a serious WTF at 1 am in the morning.</p>\\n<p>Here's part of my code. I've found that for manipulating an html string jQuery is the bomb. In the code below I take a snippet of html, remove whitespace and then rewrite links.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\tclean_snippet: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/'/gi, \\\"&#40;\\\"); // single quote will cause javascript problems inline.\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/[\\\\t\\\\n\\\\r]/gi, \\\"\\\"); // remove tabs, newlines, and return chars\\n\\t\\treturn this.rewrite_links(snippet);\\n\\t},\\n\\n\\t// Rewrite links in the snippets so they go back to the parent site.\\n\\trewrite_links: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tvar obj = jQuery(snippet);\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[href]').attr('href', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.href); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[src]').attr('src', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.src); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[action]').attr('action', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.action); });\\n\\t\\treturn com.oerglue.common.obj_to_s(obj);\\n\\t},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>(Note this code won't work standalone there are some missing methods. It's just here for illustration).</p>\\n<p>When I'm done rewriting links in the html snippet I think convert the jQuery object back into html. I originally used a derivative of the code from the StackOverFlow conversation:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nobj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n  jQuery('< div>').append(obj.clone()).remove().html();\\n},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That works until obj contains script tags which it frequently does when you are dealing with arbitrary html. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610995/jquery-cant-append-script-element\\\">It turns out that 'append' and all other similar jQuery methods are smart about how they append data and they know to look for script tags</a>.  Because of that when I was appending the object the scripts from the page I'm operating on are re-executed which causes all kinds of nasty problems - see how many web pages can handle the re-execution of bits of javascript from the page. In most cases jQuery is doing what you want. Most of the time when adding new stuff you want the scripts to run. However, when you are building a string you don't want the code to run rather you just want a string representation of the code.</p>\\n<p>I've rewritten my obj<em>to</em>s code to look like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n  obj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n\\t\\tvar tmp = jQuery('<div>');\\n\\t\\tjQuery.each(obj, function(index, item){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(!jQuery.nodeName(item, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp.append(item);\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\treturn tmp.html();\\n  },\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I currently ignore scripts when I do the append and now I get a string. I'll post an update when I have a solution for appending the script text.</p>\\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\\n<p>Thanks goes to <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/ryankshaw\\\">Ryan Shaw</a> for helping me work through this. The code below extends jQuery to include an outerHtml method and provides a way to include or exclude scripts.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\njQuery.fn.outerHtml = function(include_scripts) {\\n\\tif(include_scripts === undefined){ include_scripts = false; }\\n\\tvar clone = this.clone();\\n\\tvar items = jQuery.map(clone, function(element){\\n\\t\\tif(jQuery.nodeName(element, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(include_scripts){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvar attributes;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif(element.attributes){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tattributes = jQuery.map(element.attributes, function(attribute){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    return attribute.name + '=\\\"' + attribute.value + '\\\" ';\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  });\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn '<' + element.nodeName + ' ' + attributes.join(' ') + \\\">\\\" + jQuery(element).html() + \\\"</\\\" + element.nodeName +'>';\\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn '';\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jQuery('<div>').append(element).remove().html();\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t});\\n\\treturn items.join('');\\n}\\n\\n</pre></code>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/817477\\\">Here's the gist on github</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-02-08-converting-a-jquery-object-into-a-string/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/converting-a-jquery-object-into-a-string\",\"date\":\"2011-02-08T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Converting a jQuery Object into a String\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I love to ride and I have a serious addiction to the gear that I use when I ride.

For the most part the change consists of deleting all the code you used to hack into the Rails framework and adding subclass of '::Rails::Engine'. I'll try to put together a detailed post explaining Rails 3 engines later.</p>\\n<p>The nice thing about having a test suite in place is that you can rely on those tests to ensure the upgrade is smooth. I've always written my tests in <a href=\\\"http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda\\\">Shoulda</a>. I like the syntax and I love the macros. However, I'm switching everything over to RSpec. <a href=\\\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/731871832/this-should-change-your-mind\\\">Thoughtbot has declared they won't abandon the Shoulda community, but since they've made the switch to RSpec for new projects it's pretty clear that Shoulda as a stand alone project has a limited life.</a></p>\\n<p>Luckily I've used RSpec in a lot of other projects and it's an easy DSL to like. The conversion from shoulda to RSpec isn't a terribly difficult one. You basically need to replace \\\"context\\\" with describe and then remove your assert statements and replace then with 'should'.</p>\\n<p>One of the most difficult issues I've had to deal with is my custom shoulda macros. From what I've read the move to BDD should inspire you to use fewer macros and instead focus on specific behavior. I think that philosophy is great, but I've already got a lot of code that uses the macros and so the macros need to be brought over. The change from shoulda macros to RSpec matchers is painful, but I think the code is cleaner and easier to read.</p>\\n<p>For example, I have custom scope macros. Here's the shoulda macro:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n  # Test for 'by_title' named scope which orders by title:\\n  # scope :by_title, :order => \\\"title ASC\\\"\\n  # requires that the class have a shoulda factory\\n  def should_scope_by_title\\n    klass = get_klass\\n    factory_name = name_for_factory(klass)\\n    context \\\"'by_title' title scope\\\" do\\n      setup do\\n        klass.delete_all\\n        @first = Factory(factory_name, :title => 'a')\\n        @second = Factory(factory_name, :title => 'b')\\n      end\\n      should \\\"sort by name\\\" do\\n        assert_equal @first, klass.by_title[0]\\n        assert_equal @second, klass.by_title[1]\\n      end\\n    end\\n  end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>And here's the RSpec matcher:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n# Ensures that the model can sort by_title\\n# requires that the class have a factory\\n#\\n# Tests scope:\\n#   scope :by_title, :order => \\\"title ASC\\\"\\n#\\n# Examples:\\n#   it { should scope_by_title }\\n#\\ndef scope_by_title\\n  SortingMatcher.new(:by_title, :title)\\nend\\n\\nclass SortingMatcher # :nodoc:\\n\\n  def initialize(scope, field)\\n    @scope = scope\\n    @field = field\\n  end\\n\\n  def matches?(subject)\\n    @subject = subject\\n    @subject.class.delete_all\\n    @first = Factory(factory_name, @field => 'a')\\n    @second = Factory(factory_name, @field => 'b')\\n    @first == @subject.class.send(@scope)[0] && @second == @subject.class.send(@scope)[1]\\n  end\\n\\n  def failure_message\\n    \\\"Expected #{factory_name} to scope by #{@scope} on #{@field}\\\"\\n  end\\n\\n  def description\\n    \\\"sort by title\\\"\\n  end\\n\\n  private\\n\\n    def factory_name\\n      @subject.class.name.underscore.to_sym\\n    end\\n\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I don't profess to be a master of either but my tests work so hopefully this helps someone if you're making the same transition.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-09-18-shoulda-used-rspec/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/shoulda-used-rspec\",\"date\":\"2010-09-18T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Shoulda used RSpec\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been trying to get  Uploadify  to work inside my <a href=\\\" http://github.com/jbasdf/uploader\\\"Uploadify>uploader  gem .

There's a number of solutions that people have come up with, but mostly they sound like voodoo - Be sure to only return a '1', make sure to use an id instead of a css class, etc. I tried everything I read about and finally got mad enough to debug the fla file. </p>\\n<p>If you are that desperate make sure to get <a href=\\\"http://www.actionscript-flash-guru.com/blog/21-fireflash-firebug-console-for-flash\\\">FireFlash</a>. It will let you write to the Firebug console from within your swf file. It's very handy when you need to see what's going on inside your Actionscript while running inside the browser. I created a debug version of the fla that output the events that the swf file was attempting to fire on the client.  If you want to try it out in hopes it will help you debug <a href='http://www.justinball.comUploadify.zip'>download a zip file with the swf and fla</a>.</p>\\n<p>OK so now to the point. What's going wrong? Why doesn't 'onComplete' fire? The answer is that Uploadify binds events to the DOM item you specify via jQuery('#my-upload-container').uploadify(); These events include 'uploadifySelect', 'uploadifyOpen', 'uploadifyProgress', 'uploadifyComplete', etc. What I found is that the swf makes a call that looks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nExternalInterface.call(['jQuery'+p(q('#'+param.uploadifyID)), p(list.join(','))].join('.trigger'));\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That call does it's job - I can watch it make the ExternalInterface calls using FireFlash. The swf file attempts to trigger the events I listed above that have been bound to the element identified by id=\\\"my-upload-container\\\". However, something goes wrong and somehow the\\n'my-upload-container' element loses it's bindings and nothing is fired.</p>\\n<p>I found I can get things to work if I change 'jquery.uploadify.js' to bind the events above to the document instead of to the DOM element and then change the fla to do this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nExternalInterface.call(['jQuery(document)', p(list.join(','))].join('.trigger'));\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That means that the events do fire however it's a hack so I kept digging (and swearing) and I bummed some help off Joel.....</p>\\n<p>It turns out that the problem wasn't Flash. It wasn't uploadify. It wasn't jQuery although all of those components seemed like they might be the source of the problem.  The problem as it turns out was TinyMCE. (As it turns out TinyMCE is the source of a lot of my problems but I still like it).</p>\\n<p>In our specific case we've built a plugin to TinyMCE that let's you upload files to the server. (You can find it in the <a href=\\\"http://github.com/tatemae/muck-contents\\\">muck-contents gem</a>). We use the TinyMCE scripts to build our popups which means using 'tiny<em>mce/tiny</em>mce_popup.js'. If you look in that code very deeply you will discover this code around line 320:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n  if ((nv = t.editor.translate(h)) && nv != h)\\n    document.body.innerHTML = nv;\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Notice that the way the popup handles translations is to replace the entire document with new html. If you use jQuery and your bindings have already been setup you realize this is very bad because everything you've setup using the standard methods just vanished. (This goes for all methods - click, bind, etc. They will all go away).</p>\\n<p>ie This won't work:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\njQuery(document).ready(function(){\\n   jQuery('#mce_uploader_upload').uploadify(mce_uploader_options);\\n});\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>The solution is simple and probably obvious to a seasoned TinyMCE dev (which I'm not). Put your code into a different initialization block:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\ntinyMCEPopup.onInit.add(function(ed) {\\n   jQuery('#mce_uploader_upload').uploadify(mce_uploader_options);\\n});\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>As an aside I should mention that if you need help getting uploadify running in your Rails application there's already a couple of great tutorials.
