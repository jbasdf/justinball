That means <a href=\"http://www.ico.org/trade_e.asp\">coffee is the most widely traded agriculture commodity in the world</a>.\nInject hot air, sugar and fat into coffee and a 25 cent cup of truck stop pick me up becomes a $6 Starbucks masterpiece.\n<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/05/a-better-way-to-think-about-yo/\">Nestle saw an 800% increase in profits with the Nespresso.</a>\nIt's the same coffee but if you put it in a little cup, make it easy to prepare and add a bit of flavoring the commodity becomes a\nluxury. The proof of our love for coffee is the price we pay.</p>\n<p>I'm guilty. I pay just as much for my morning pick me up. I drink it every morning. It wakes me up. It keeps me healthy. It powers my rides.</p>\n<p>My secret is that I've never drunk coffee, but I do have a 'Mormon' version that I feel fine sharing with my even my youngest kids.</p>\n<p>The measurements are estimates.

Drink it fast or it will start to solidify and turns into nasty grossness.\nOne warning - it's not low calorie but it will wake you up.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"My Morning Coffee",date:"January 01, 2014",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/my-morning-coffee"}}}});
