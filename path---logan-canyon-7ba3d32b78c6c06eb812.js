I was always to worried about traffic. We tried it today. It is a fun ride. The road follows the river up the canyon and there are plenty of trees that provide brief moments of shade. The ride up hurt a little bit, but on several sections we managed 23-25 mph. That should have told us something. I am not in good enough shape to ride that fast uphill. The ride back was fun. The wind that sent us up at higher speed slowed us down. It seems strange to only be able to do 20 on a downhill, but the wind seems to want to hold you in place - like the canyon has consumed you and is not going to puke you back out. So my mileage today should total somewhere around 44 miles. I have 14 commuting and 30 up and back with the canyon. I need to do more, but I'll do what I have time for. It is fun.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Logan Canyon",date:"May 30, 2007",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/logan-canyon"}}}});
