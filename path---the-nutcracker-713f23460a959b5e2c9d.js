She had all kinds of questions and comments. Why is there a giant Nutcracker on the curtains? When does the Nutcracker come out? There are a lot of kids. I like the girls in the purple dresses. Why is daddy surfing the net on his phone and eating tic tacs?</p>\n<p>Callie asked the girls what their favorite part was. Aubrey said she liked the clowns, Alyssa liked the sugar plum fairy and Jenna liked the dew drop princesses. I like the Arabian princess. During that part I was really enjoying ballet and thinking that I was very cultured.</p>\n<p>It was fun. The girls clapped like pros. We'll probably go again next year.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"The Nutcracker",date:"December 04, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/the-nutcracker"}}}});
