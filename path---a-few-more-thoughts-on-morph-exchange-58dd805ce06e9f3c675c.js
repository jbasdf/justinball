Basically I have 4 days to build the application - it has to be done by Tuesday.\nBecause of the simplicity of deployment on Morph Exchange I decided to deploy the application on their platform. I don\'t have time to setup a full Rails deployment environment.</p>\n<p>One problem. Facebook applications require access to the Facebook API. I used <a href="http://rfacebook.rubyforge.org/">rfacebook</a> because that is the library I have used in the past and could quickly get the application done.\n(<a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker</a> is another library worth looking at if you are building a Facebok Application). I deployed the application but it wouldn\'t start. I did some checking and finally found their deployment log.\nTurns out the Facebook gems are not installed. <a href="http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything">There is a way to package up your gems into your project</a>. (<a href="http://gemsonrails.rubyforge.org/">This site will help as well</a>.)\nWith the popularity of Facebook applications growing and the need for scalability on demand I would think that having the Facebook gems already in place would be a must for a platform like MorphExchange.\nI submitted a ticket yesterday and haven\'t heard back yet. Hopefully they are responsive. I deployed on Morph for the speed of deployment. The clock is ticking for me.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"A Few More Thoughts On Morph Exchange",date:"April 26, 2008",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/a-few-more-thoughts-on-morph-exchange"}}}});
