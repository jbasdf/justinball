The process of hosting many of clients using a single piece of software presents a number of challenges and one of the largest has been customizing the look for each customer. I've tried solving this a number of different ways over the years including writing a gem called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/jbasdf/disguise\\\" title=\\\"Disguise Gem\\\">disguise</a> that let's you customize look of your Rails site in a way similar to the method Wordpress uses. That gem will customize the views based on the domain, but it's not especially efficient.</p>\\n<p>With <a href=\\\"http://www.oerglue.com\\\" title=\\\"OER Glue\\\">OER Glue</a> we needed something that didn't effect performance and that didn't require a new deploy every time we need to customize a view for a customer. If you've run into this problem then you've problem also prayed to the omniscient Google and found this <a href=\\\"http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2011/04/default-views-in-rails-3-0-with-custom-resolvers/\\\" title=\\\"Custom Resolvers in Rails 3.1\\\">great article by Jose Valim on creating custom resolvers</a>. About half way through I got really excited and decided to check out his book <a href=\\\"http://plataformatec.com.br/crafting-rails-applications/\\\" title=\\\"Crafting Rails Applications\\\">Crafting Rails Applications</a>. Then I got really, really excited when I realized I had already bought it.</p>\\n<p>It turns out Chapter 3 from the book describes creating a custom template resolver for Ruby on Rails that pulls templates from the database. It also caches them so you aren't constantly hitting the database which would result in a nasty performance hit. If you want to understand how the resolver works then it really is worth buying the book. The solution Jose presents solved 90% of my problem.</p>\\n<p>However, I was still left with one really big issue - how do I get information from the controller into the custom view resolver? Specifically, I needed to pass information about the current domain into the resolver so that I could scope the views to the current account.\\nHere's the specific snippet responsible for retrieving template from the database:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n    def find_templates(name, prefix, partial, details)\\n      conditions = {\\n        :path    => normalize_path(name, prefix, partial),\\n        :locale  => normalize_array(details[:locale]).first,\\n        :format  => normalize_array(details[:formats]).first,\\n        :handler => normalize_array(details[:handlers]),\\n        :partial => partial || false\\n      }\\n      @account.custom_views.where(conditions).map do |record|\\n        initialize_template(record)\\n      end\\n    end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>The problem is that in the book the resolver is a singleton and so there is no opportunity to pass in the an account and setup an @account value since the resolver is setup in the application controller like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\\n  prepend_view_path SqlTemplate::Resolver.instance\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>At first I decided to just use a global on the current thread:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nThread[:account] = current_account\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Then inside the resolver I could recover the account from the global:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n    def find_templates(name, prefix, partial, details)\\n      conditions = {\\n        :path    => normalize_path(name, prefix, partial),\\n        :locale  => normalize_array(details[:locale]).first,\\n        :format  => normalize_array(details[:formats]).first,\\n        :handler => normalize_array(details[:handlers]),\\n        :partial => partial || false\\n      }\\n      Thread[:account].custom_views.where(conditions).map do |record|\\n        initialize_template(record)\\n      end\\n    end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That works but setting a global on the current thread felt like a big hack. (<a href=\\\"http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/lets-stop-polluting-the-threadcurrent-hash/\\\" title=\\\"Stop polluting the Thread.current hash\\\">Here's a good article on Thread.current</a>  ) Lucky for me Jose was willing to spend a little time working with me and the resulting code works without globals. Instead of passing a global around we removed the Singleton code from the resolver and create an instance of the resolver per each account:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\\n  before_filter :set_resolver\\n\\n  def current_account\\n    @current_account ||= Account.find_by_domain(request.host) || Account.find_by_code(request.subdomains.first) || Account.first\\n  end\\n\\n  @@account_resolver = {}\\n\\n  def account_resolver_for(account)\\n    @@account_resolver[account.id] ||= CustomView::Resolver.new(account)\\n  end\\n\\n  def set_resolver\\n    return unless current_account\\n    resolver = account_resolver_for(current_account)\\n    resolver.update_account(current_account)\\n    prepend_view_path resolver\\n  end\\n\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In the resolver we take the account as a parameter. The trick is that the account also has a counter called 'custom<em>view</em>cache_count' that increments anytime a view is changed thus allowing us to expire the cache across all instances and servers. Since I have to recover the account model from the database on each request anyway this doesn't require any more database hits than I was making before adding this solution:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n  class Resolver < ActionView::Resolver\\n\\n    def initialize(account)\\n      @account = account\\n    end\\n\\n    # Check if the custom_view_cache_count is still the same, if not clear the cache\\n    def update_account(updated_account)\\n      self.clear_cache unless @account.custom_view_cache_count == updated_account.custom_view_cache_count\\n      @account = updated_account\\n    end\\n  end\\n\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>This has a couple of benefits. The biggest is that you no longer have to pass around a global, but another is that the cache is specific to each account so you don't end up expire the cache for all accounts unnecessarily.</p>\\n<p>Big thanks to Jose for helping me figure this one out!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-09-27-customizing-views-for-a-multi-tenant-application-using-ruby-on-rails-custom-resolvers/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/customizing-views-for-a-multi-tenant-application-using-ruby-on-rails-custom-resolvers\",\"date\":\"2011-09-27T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Customizing Views for a Multi-Tenant Application Using Ruby on Rails Custom Resolvers\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Ruby On Rails\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been integrating  backbone.js  into  OER Glue .

The tutorial is for an older version so substitute router for controller and you'll be most of the way to the latest version.</p>\\n<p>I followed the example and wrote some admin interface code. When I was writing the code I wondered about doing this over and over again:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nnew App.Views.Edit({ model: doc });\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In the example that code greats a new view anytime you hit the new or edit action. The edit view code binds to the submit form event so that whenever the form is submitted it calls the save action in the edit view:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n    events: {\\n        \\\"submit form\\\": \\\"save\\\"\\n    },\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That makes sense, but the one thing the tutorial doesn't teach you to do is clean up the views. In fact I don't think it has to because it just creates a new element and adds it to the DOM with each call to new. However, in my case I use the 'el' attribute to attach my view to the DOM like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nApp.Views.Edit = Backbone.View.extend({\\n  el: '#new-custom-view-form',\\n  ...\\n});\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In that case if you keep creating new views with new App.Views.Edit you'll also keep binding the submit form event to the same submit button. The result is that if you press the 'Save' button on the form it will call the event for every view that you've created. That can be very bad since you will end saving models to the server that you didn't intend.</p>\\n<p>My solution was to create the view once in the router's initialize method and then I set the model in the view whenever new or edit is called. That works great in my case. The <a href=\\\"http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/backbone-js-on-rails\\\">Thoughtbot guys are writing a backbone.js book</a> that explains the creating a 'Swappable' router that calls a 'leave' method whenever the same view is instantiated again. The leave method is responsible for unbinding any events and should remove the element from the DOM. The book isn't done, but what they've put together looks good. I think $49 is pretty steep for an ebook when Pragmatic Programmers is charging more like $20-$30, but I paid the money so it doesn't really matter what I think.</p>\\n<p>On a side note the James Yu's tutoral also has this line:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nBackbone.history.saveLocation('documents/' + model.id);\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That won't work in the latest version of backbone.js. Instead do:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nBackbone.history.navigate('documents/' + model.id);\\n</pre></code>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-09-14-backbone-js-clean-up-your-views/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/backbone-js-clean-up-your-views\",\"date\":\"2011-09-14T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Backbone.js &#8211; Clean up your views\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Javascript\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"OER Glue  makes heavy use of jQuery.

We're currently working on a proxy version of the technology that won't require installing a browser plugin. It's pretty cool.</p>\\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for us has been ensuring consistent look, feel and operation of our technology across any possible website on the Internet. That's not a small challenge. A key to making everything work is to not stomp on anything the web page is already doing. We use jQuery and so do a lot of page on the Web. That means we have to carefully load the version that we use (since lots of sites use old versions) and then put everything back. A call to noConflict make this possible:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\noerglue_jquery = window.jQuery.noConflict(true);\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That magic doesn't come without costs. We don't use any jQuery plugins because it's not likely they will work with our scoped version of jQuery. I also ran into an interested problem with class selectors. For some reason jQuery class selectors for the oerglue_jquery object return an empty array on the MIT OCW site. However, for some reason they work fine on other sites. I found the problem a bit baffling and honestly I don't know the cause. I'm hoping someone smarter than me can expose my jQuery ignorance.</p>\\n<p>In the mean time I have a cool solution that comes with a performance boost. In the MIT OCW case selectors by id return a value. That means I can first get the OER Glue toolbar container by its id. I then pass that as the scope to the jQuery selector that uses classes and like magic everything works. The side benefit is that adding scope makes your selectors faster since jQuery won't have to traverse the entire DOM.</p>\\n<p>That brings up a good point. Always scope your jQuery selectors and use ids where possible.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-08-26-pushing-my-luck-with-jquery-scope-matters/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/pushing-my-luck-with-jquery-scope-matters\",\"date\":\"2011-08-26T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Pushing my luck with jQuery.

Given the popularity of node.js that's an easy way to grasp the architecture. Both use an <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop\\\">\\\"event loop\\\" architecture</a>. I think that the primary difference is the philosophy. node.js is close to the metal while <a href=\\\"http://www.igvita.com/2011/03/08/goliath-non-blocking-ruby-19-web-server/\\\">Golaith abstracts away the callbacks to make writing code as simple as possible an feature that IIya and the team at Post Rank felt was important for maintainability</a>.</p>\\n<p>That's not to say node.js is not as good. I really love node.js and we had started investigating <a href=\\\"node-http-proxy\\\">node-http-proxy</a> from the <a href=\\\"http://www.nodejitsu.com/\\\">nodejitsu</a> guys. I like the code base but it wasn't quite the right fit. For performance (low memory usage) <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues/58\\\">node-http-proxy doesn't buffer what's it's proxying and so you don't have a chance to modify the DOM</a>.

After four days of kids, mosquitoes and me biking every day my wife is not going to divorce me so it's been a great vacation. Of course as I type this Callie is giving me grief that of all the things I write about it's the biking so stay tuned on the divorce front.</p>\\n<p>Actually, Callie is a great wife and very patient to let me get up, abandon her to get the kids ready and ride for a couple of hours each morning and once in the middle of the day. I'm not winning any father of the year awards but she might deserve sainthood. I owe her big time and so once again I offer to purchase her any bike she likes. (and we're going on vacation again this next week with her family and I'm planning on taking the bikes so I need points).</p>\\n<p>It's amazing how hard it is to find a place to ride. I keep thinking that the Internet is an omnipotent source of all truth and knowledge, but there's not much online about riding in Teton Valley. I knew there was a bike path since I'd seen it before and my dad was a part of that project, but other than that it's hard to tune into the local biking scene unless you are a local. (It's the same everywhere I go). I finally found some maps hidden on <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/\\\">Teton Valley Trails and Pathways</a>. They're stowed away under <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/resources/maps\\\">resources -> maps</a>. The one I found most useful is the <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP Cycling Map</a> which listed a couple of rides that looked like they made sense..</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.vrbo.com/331221\\\">We stayed at a great cabin in the middle of the valley just a few miles north of Victor</a>. Since it wasn't far from the bike path that goes from Victor to Driggs I was able to utilize that path the first day and do \\\"The Loop\\\" - a 25 mile loop around the main part of the valley. I normally avoid bike paths when riding at higher speeds since slamming into a pedestrian makes them really mad and there's really not much glory in passing a 5 year old on his BMX. However, in Teton Valley early in the morning the bike path is relatively vacant, and you want to avoid the section of highway it parallels unless you have a lot of life insurance. Between the tourists gawking at the scenery, the locals treating it like the autobahn and the fact there is no shoulder your likely hood of early death.</p>\\n<p>This year the water is high all over the inter-mountain west. We've had plenty of flooding in Cache Valley and Teton Valley has seen similar issues. The entire valley floor is pretty much a giant swamp that collects the run off from the surrounding hills. I was glad for my cross bike on day one while doing the loop since the bike path had become a channel for one of the local creeks. The road across the valley from east to west had low traffic and was fast. I did have to stop to take a picture of a bald eagle: . The <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP cycling map</a> mentions that the west side of the loop has a 2 mile section of gravel road that's not a big deal. I'm sure if you don't love your road bike you can ride it just fine, but I'm pretty fond of my carbon wheels and the paint on my road bike so again the cross bike was a great choice for \\\"The Loop\\\". I cut the ride a bit short and came back across on North Cedron road which is the road where the cabin was. It's downhill from the main road so was able to hit it going 24 plus MPH which was fun until I hit a section of the road where for some reason they decided to dump the remains of a stone quarry. I nearly wiped out when the gravel turned to 3-4\\\" rocks. Callie doesn't like it when I go to the hospital so I dropped my pace and did some swearing. The next section of road was under water, but being a man and all I couldn't let that stop me. I was actually surprised when it didn't and saddened that no one was around to see it. The creek there had cut a channel across the road that was a foot deep which buried the bottom half of my bike in liquid. I'm guessing that's why my power meter doesn't work anymore.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.88429752066116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0609\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg 1936w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>I slept in the next day and so decided I would just do a quick up and down the bike path. It ended up being about 20 miles and I totally left several bmx riding 5 year olds and a couple of old people in the dust. The bike path trip was actually to scout out places to park in Driggs so I could ride Ski Hill road. It felt pretty wussy to drive 8 miles so I could ride my bike, but surprisingly the point of a family trip isn't to avoid the family so I had to keep my rides short. I also checked out the local bike shop <a href=\\\"http://www.peakedsports.com/Home.html\\\">Peaked Sports</a> - sort of anyway. I rode by. I have a history of racking up grounds for divorce credit card bills at bike shops so I thought it best that I look from a distance. They rent bikes so if you don't bring your own you can still ride. Personally I prefer to bring my own stuff. It feels weird to play with other people's equipment.</p>\\n<p>I saved Ski Hill road up to Grand Targee for the last day. After that ride I'm totally ready to buy one of the foreclosed cabins and spend the rest of my days just riding up and down the mountain. This is what it looks like:\\n.\\nIf you are in town for one day do this ride. The pavement is smooth. The road ends at a ski resort so there's not a lot of traffic. The views are spectacular. I get the impression that this is the ride the locals do since I saw quite a few other bikers. I also saw a group of 3 skateboarders coming down the road. I think they were on a suicide mission.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-9c565.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 74.69135802469135%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0614\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-fd4ba.jpg 1950w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-9c565.jpg 2592w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>There are a few other rides I want to do but didn't have time. There's a bike path from Tetonia to St Anthony that follows the old rail bed. My dad also did the engineering for that trail and has ridden it on a motorcycle and said its an amazing ride. (It's closed to motors now. When my dad did it they hadn't put a deck on the old rail trestle. He said it was a rush to ride that high up across the railroad ties without any railing.) That path is gravel but flat and seems like a great candidate for a cross bike.</p>\\n<p>I didn't do any mountain biking since I didn't have the time or my mountain bike, but the map lists a number of local trails which look amazing. You could spend several weeks riding and not cover the same ground. Given that I'm not a pro-biker and that I'm not retiring I probably won't be taking up permanent residence in Teton Valley any time soon, but we might have to start taking a few more family vacations to the area of the next couple of years.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-07-10-cycling-in-teton-valley-driggs-id/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/cycling-in-teton-valley-driggs-id\",\"date\":\"2011-07-10T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Cycling in Teton Valley (Driggs, ID)\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Cycling\"],\"image\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"sizes\":{\"src\":\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-381d6.jpg\"}}}}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I messed up my local install of MySQL (it's a long story that involves me almost throwing a punch to my 30\\\" monitor).

A big thanks to <a href=\\\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/advisoryboard/detail.cfm?mem=1110&#x26;group=3&#x26;pid=822\\\">John Pestana</a> for hosting the first party of the BoomStartup program. I can imagine it's a bit stressful to invite 20-30 strangers to your very nice home.</p>\\n<p>I had a great time talking with fellow founders and the mentors and getting a better idea of what they are working on. One conversation stands out in particular. I had a chance to discuss business development and entrepreneurship with <a href=\\\"http://www.johnrichards.me/\\\">John Richards</a>. Our discussion revolved around how entrepreneurs in the technology space create innovative products that result in good paying jobs and how it's important for cities, counties and states to encourage that type of development. Unfortunately, it's all to often easy to try and bring in another Walmart or Home Depot (with their poor wages and lousy benefits) because they bring in immediate revenue via sales taxes.</p>\\n<p>I had a great chance to talk Lego and toy trains with John Pestana. I had assumed he was starting <a href=\\\"http://www.exactrail.com/\\\">ExactRail</a> because once you've hit a home run like Omniture you can do whatever you like and why not build a company aligned with a favorite hobby? I was wrong. Sort of. John likes trains, but his vision for that company in the space is extraordinary and will likely revolutionize how the industry builds and markets trains.</p>\\n<p>The energy in the room was exciting. Everyone there was optimistic about the future and clearly believes that their idea will revolutionize their space. It's fun to hang out in an atmosphere like that.</p>\\n<p>I contrast that with <a href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/05/13/136274980/how-to-create-a-job\\\">a story I heard listening to NPR</a> on the way back to Salt Lake. It was a series of interviews with politicians, business owners, business development organizations and employees. In one of the interviews 5 candidates were interviewed at the same time to determine whether or not they were worthy to make $10/hr (with benefits) to work in a call center. The job sounded terrible. They monitor your every move. If you go to the bathroom you clock out. If you have any down time them how will you fill it to benefit the company. Basically, can we program you and turn you into a human regurgitation machine since customers prefer to talk to a live body. I sensed all creatively being drained from each of this individuals all so they could earn 20k per year.</p>\\n<p>That's not the kind of job growth I envision for this country.</p>\\n<p>Another set of interviews occurred at a business development conference which the interviewer described as a bunch of cordial thieves. Basically, if you are an economic development officer, your job is to lure companies into your area. You usually do this through a combination of sales pitch (our people are awesome) and tax breaks. The only problem with this process is that there are no net jobs created. Once place simple steals jobs from another place.</p>\\n<p>That reminded me of a <a href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/14/startups-or-behemoths-which-are-we-going-to-bet-on/\\\">TechCrunch article from a while back that asked the simple question: who's responsible for job growth, startups or big business</a>? Not surprisingly, according to a <a href=\\\"http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedFiles/firm-formation-inception-8-2-10.pdf\\\">study from the Kauffman foundation</a> the net job creation in this country comes from startups. Big business moves jobs around to take advantage of better tax breaks, etc, but overall they don't really generate a lot of new jobs. That begs the question, why do all of these economic development offices put so much of our tax money into luring companies when they should instead focus on the talent they already have, nurture it, and build new opportunities - the 100k per year jobs instead of the 20k call center sweat shops?</p>\\n<p>I think programs like BoomStartup and similar programs throughout the country focus on what they economic development offices have missed. It's true that not all the companies coming out of these incubator programs will turn into the next Twitter or Facebook. Some may fail. However, many will turn into impressive corporations that contribute significantly to the economy. I look forward to finding out which kind we'll be. My bet is that we'll be one of the success stories.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-05-14-boomstartup-opening-social/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/boomstartup-opening-social\",\"date\":\"2011-05-14T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"BoomStartup Opening Social\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"BoomStartup\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"We've been building OER Glue since this last July and the result is a piece of technology that when people see it they have the same reaction they have during a magic show - HOLY SH@#$ how do you do that?

Go add a comment and push the request, please.</p>\\n<p>I was using the solution from stackoverflow and it worked well until one day all of the contents of my page vanished upon execution of a method leaving me with a serious WTF at 1 am in the morning.</p>\\n<p>Here's part of my code. I've found that for manipulating an html string jQuery is the bomb. In the code below I take a snippet of html, remove whitespace and then rewrite links.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\tclean_snippet: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/'/gi, \\\"&#40;\\\"); // single quote will cause javascript problems inline.\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/[\\\\t\\\\n\\\\r]/gi, \\\"\\\"); // remove tabs, newlines, and return chars\\n\\t\\treturn this.rewrite_links(snippet);\\n\\t},\\n\\n\\t// Rewrite links in the snippets so they go back to the parent site.\\n\\trewrite_links: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tvar obj = jQuery(snippet);\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[href]').attr('href', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.href); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[src]').attr('src', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.src); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[action]').attr('action', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.action); });\\n\\t\\treturn com.oerglue.common.obj_to_s(obj);\\n\\t},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>(Note this code won't work standalone there are some missing methods. It's just here for illustration).</p>\\n<p>When I'm done rewriting links in the html snippet I think convert the jQuery object back into html. I originally used a derivative of the code from the StackOverFlow conversation:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nobj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n  jQuery('< div>').append(obj.clone()).remove().html();\\n},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That works until obj contains script tags which it frequently does when you are dealing with arbitrary html. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610995/jquery-cant-append-script-element\\\">It turns out that 'append' and all other similar jQuery methods are smart about how they append data and they know to look for script tags</a>.  Because of that when I was appending the object the scripts from the page I'm operating on are re-executed which causes all kinds of nasty problems - see how many web pages can handle the re-execution of bits of javascript from the page. In most cases jQuery is doing what you want. Most of the time when adding new stuff you want the scripts to run. However, when you are building a string you don't want the code to run rather you just want a string representation of the code.</p>\\n<p>I've rewritten my obj<em>to</em>s code to look like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n  obj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n\\t\\tvar tmp = jQuery('<div>');\\n\\t\\tjQuery.each(obj, function(index, item){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(!jQuery.nodeName(item, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp.append(item);\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\treturn tmp.html();\\n  },\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I currently ignore scripts when I do the append and now I get a string.

If you've run into this problem then you've problem also prayed to the omniscient Google and found this <a href=\\\"http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2011/04/default-views-in-rails-3-0-with-custom-resolvers/\\\" title=\\\"Custom Resolvers in Rails 3.1\\\">great article by Jose Valim on creating custom resolvers</a>. About half way through I got really excited and decided to check out his book <a href=\\\"http://plataformatec.com.br/crafting-rails-applications/\\\" title=\\\"Crafting Rails Applications\\\">Crafting Rails Applications</a>. Then I got really, really excited when I realized I had already bought it.</p>\\n<p>It turns out Chapter 3 from the book describes creating a custom template resolver for Ruby on Rails that pulls templates from the database. It also caches them so you aren't constantly hitting the database which would result in a nasty performance hit. If you want to understand how the resolver works then it really is worth buying the book. The solution Jose presents solved 90% of my problem.</p>\\n<p>However, I was still left with one really big issue - how do I get information from the controller into the custom view resolver? Specifically, I needed to pass information about the current domain into the resolver so that I could scope the views to the current account.\\nHere's the specific snippet responsible for retrieving template from the database:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n    def find_templates(name, prefix, partial, details)\\n      conditions = {\\n        :path    => normalize_path(name, prefix, partial),\\n        :locale  => normalize_array(details[:locale]).first,\\n        :format  => normalize_array(details[:formats]).first,\\n        :handler => normalize_array(details[:handlers]),\\n        :partial => partial || false\\n      }\\n      @account.custom_views.where(conditions).map do |record|\\n        initialize_template(record)\\n      end\\n    end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>The problem is that in the book the resolver is a singleton and so there is no opportunity to pass in the an account and setup an @account value since the resolver is setup in the application controller like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\\n  prepend_view_path SqlTemplate::Resolver.instance\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>At first I decided to just use a global on the current thread:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nThread[:account] = current_account\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Then inside the resolver I could recover the account from the global:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n    def find_templates(name, prefix, partial, details)\\n      conditions = {\\n        :path    => normalize_path(name, prefix, partial),\\n        :locale  => normalize_array(details[:locale]).first,\\n        :format  => normalize_array(details[:formats]).first,\\n        :handler => normalize_array(details[:handlers]),\\n        :partial => partial || false\\n      }\\n      Thread[:account].custom_views.where(conditions).map do |record|\\n        initialize_template(record)\\n      end\\n    end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That works but setting a global on the current thread felt like a big hack. (<a href=\\\"http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/lets-stop-polluting-the-threadcurrent-hash/\\\" title=\\\"Stop polluting the Thread.current hash\\\">Here's a good article on Thread.current</a>  ) Lucky for me Jose was willing to spend a little time working with me and the resulting code works without globals. Instead of passing a global around we removed the Singleton code from the resolver and create an instance of the resolver per each account:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\\n  before_filter :set_resolver\\n\\n  def current_account\\n    @current_account ||= Account.find_by_domain(request.host) || Account.find_by_code(request.subdomains.first) || Account.first\\n  end\\n\\n  @@account_resolver = {}\\n\\n  def account_resolver_for(account)\\n    @@account_resolver[account.id] ||= CustomView::Resolver.new(account)\\n  end\\n\\n  def set_resolver\\n    return unless current_account\\n    resolver = account_resolver_for(current_account)\\n    resolver.update_account(current_account)\\n    prepend_view_path resolver\\n  end\\n\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In the resolver we take the account as a parameter. The trick is that the account also has a counter called 'custom<em>view</em>cache_count' that increments anytime a view is changed thus allowing us to expire the cache across all instances and servers. Since I have to recover the account model from the database on each request anyway this doesn't require any more database hits than I was making before adding this solution:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n  class Resolver < ActionView::Resolver\\n\\n    def initialize(account)\\n      @account = account\\n    end\\n\\n    # Check if the custom_view_cache_count is still the same, if not clear the cache\\n    def update_account(updated_account)\\n      self.clear_cache unless @account.custom_view_cache_count == updated_account.custom_view_cache_count\\n      @account = updated_account\\n    end\\n  end\\n\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>This has a couple of benefits. The biggest is that you no longer have to pass around a global, but another is that the cache is specific to each account so you don't end up expire the cache for all accounts unnecessarily.</p>\\n<p>Big thanks to Jose for helping me figure this one out!</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-09-27-customizing-views-for-a-multi-tenant-application-using-ruby-on-rails-custom-resolvers/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/customizing-views-for-a-multi-tenant-application-using-ruby-on-rails-custom-resolvers\",\"date\":\"2011-09-27T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Customizing Views for a Multi-Tenant Application Using Ruby on Rails Custom Resolvers\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Ruby On Rails\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been integrating  backbone.js  into  OER Glue .

After years of writing all kinds of spaghetti javascript code to manage client side ajax backbone.js is like manna from heaven. If you're new to backbone.js and you want to use it with Ruby on Rails <a href=\\\"http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/\\\">James Yu has a couple of great posts to get you going</a>. The tutorial is for an older version so substitute router for controller and you'll be most of the way to the latest version.</p>\\n<p>I followed the example and wrote some admin interface code. When I was writing the code I wondered about doing this over and over again:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nnew App.Views.Edit({ model: doc });\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In the example that code greats a new view anytime you hit the new or edit action. The edit view code binds to the submit form event so that whenever the form is submitted it calls the save action in the edit view:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n    events: {\\n        \\\"submit form\\\": \\\"save\\\"\\n    },\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That makes sense, but the one thing the tutorial doesn't teach you to do is clean up the views. In fact I don't think it has to because it just creates a new element and adds it to the DOM with each call to new. However, in my case I use the 'el' attribute to attach my view to the DOM like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nApp.Views.Edit = Backbone.View.extend({\\n  el: '#new-custom-view-form',\\n  ...\\n});\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In that case if you keep creating new views with new App.Views.Edit you'll also keep binding the submit form event to the same submit button. The result is that if you press the 'Save' button on the form it will call the event for every view that you've created. That can be very bad since you will end saving models to the server that you didn't intend.</p>\\n<p>My solution was to create the view once in the router's initialize method and then I set the model in the view whenever new or edit is called. That works great in my case. The <a href=\\\"http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/backbone-js-on-rails\\\">Thoughtbot guys are writing a backbone.js book</a> that explains the creating a 'Swappable' router that calls a 'leave' method whenever the same view is instantiated again. The leave method is responsible for unbinding any events and should remove the element from the DOM. The book isn't done, but what they've put together looks good. I think $49 is pretty steep for an ebook when Pragmatic Programmers is charging more like $20-$30, but I paid the money so it doesn't really matter what I think.</p>\\n<p>On a side note the James Yu's tutoral also has this line:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nBackbone.history.saveLocation('documents/' + model.id);\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That won't work in the latest version of backbone.js. Instead do:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nBackbone.history.navigate('documents/' + model.id);\\n</pre></code>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-09-14-backbone-js-clean-up-your-views/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/backbone-js-clean-up-your-views\",\"date\":\"2011-09-14T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Backbone.js &#8211; Clean up your views\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Javascript\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"OER Glue  makes heavy use of jQuery.

We're currently working on a proxy version of the technology that won't require installing a browser plugin. It's pretty cool.</p>\\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for us has been ensuring consistent look, feel and operation of our technology across any possible website on the Internet. That's not a small challenge. A key to making everything work is to not stomp on anything the web page is already doing. We use jQuery and so do a lot of page on the Web. That means we have to carefully load the version that we use (since lots of sites use old versions) and then put everything back. A call to noConflict make this possible:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\noerglue_jquery = window.jQuery.noConflict(true);\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That magic doesn't come without costs. We don't use any jQuery plugins because it's not likely they will work with our scoped version of jQuery. I also ran into an interested problem with class selectors. For some reason jQuery class selectors for the oerglue_jquery object return an empty array on the MIT OCW site. However, for some reason they work fine on other sites. I found the problem a bit baffling and honestly I don't know the cause. I'm hoping someone smarter than me can expose my jQuery ignorance.</p>\\n<p>In the mean time I have a cool solution that comes with a performance boost. In the MIT OCW case selectors by id return a value. That means I can first get the OER Glue toolbar container by its id. I then pass that as the scope to the jQuery selector that uses classes and like magic everything works. The side benefit is that adding scope makes your selectors faster since jQuery won't have to traverse the entire DOM.</p>\\n<p>That brings up a good point. Always scope your jQuery selectors and use ids where possible.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-08-26-pushing-my-luck-with-jquery-scope-matters/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/pushing-my-luck-with-jquery-scope-matters\",\"date\":\"2011-08-26T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Pushing my luck with jQuery.

Given the popularity of node.js that's an easy way to grasp the architecture. Both use an <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop\\\">\\\"event loop\\\" architecture</a>. I think that the primary difference is the philosophy. node.js is close to the metal while <a href=\\\"http://www.igvita.com/2011/03/08/goliath-non-blocking-ruby-19-web-server/\\\">Golaith abstracts away the callbacks to make writing code as simple as possible an feature that IIya and the team at Post Rank felt was important for maintainability</a>.</p>\\n<p>That's not to say node.js is not as good. I really love node.js and we had started investigating <a href=\\\"node-http-proxy\\\">node-http-proxy</a> from the <a href=\\\"http://www.nodejitsu.com/\\\">nodejitsu</a> guys. I like the code base but it wasn't quite the right fit. For performance (low memory usage) <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues/58\\\">node-http-proxy doesn't buffer what's it's proxying and so you don't have a chance to modify the DOM</a>. It looks like there is some effort going into making that possible but after reading through the issues I've come to the conclusion that what we need is something a little more than just a proxy.</p>\\n<p>Enter Goliath.</p>\\n<p>Here's a really simple example of what we will end up doing:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nrequire 'rubygems'\\nrequire 'goliath'\\nrequire 'em-synchrony'\\nrequire 'em-synchrony/em-http'\\n\\nclass OerglueProxy < Goliath::API\\n  use Goliath::Rack::Params\\n\\n  def response(env)\\n    req = EM::HttpRequest.new(\\\"http://www.google.com/\\\").get\\n    resp = req.response\\n\\n    [200, {'X-Goliath' => 'Proxy'}, resp]\\n  end\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>In just a few lines of code we're able to retrieve a page and return the results. All the async code that EventMachine provides and that gives us great performance is hidden away. We can focus on our logic. We can also utilize our team's Ruby development strength. I like that.</p>\\n<p>I did run into issues getting the right version of the gems I needed. Specifically, I kept getting this error:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n`class_eval': undefined method `get' for module `EventMachine::HTTPMethods' (NameError)\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I found <a href=\\\"https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony/issues/29\\\">a solution in this thread</a>, but it didn't quite work for me.</p>\\n<p>Luckily bundler makes it easy to get the exact version of the gem you need and with a little playing around here's what I came up with:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nsource \\\"http://rubygems.org\\\"\\n\\ngem 'goliath', '0.9.1'\\ngem 'eventmachine', '1.0.0.beta.3'\\ngem 'em-http-request', '1.0.0.beta.4'\\ngem \\\"em-synchrony\\\", '0.3.0.beta.1'\\n\\ngroup :test, :development do\\n  gem \\\"rspec\\\"\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Goliath has been in use by Post Rank for over a year and serves ~500 requests per second.

After four days of kids, mosquitoes and me biking every day my wife is not going to divorce me so it's been a great vacation. Of course as I type this Callie is giving me grief that of all the things I write about it's the biking so stay tuned on the divorce front.</p>\\n<p>Actually, Callie is a great wife and very patient to let me get up, abandon her to get the kids ready and ride for a couple of hours each morning and once in the middle of the day. I'm not winning any father of the year awards but she might deserve sainthood. I owe her big time and so once again I offer to purchase her any bike she likes. (and we're going on vacation again this next week with her family and I'm planning on taking the bikes so I need points).</p>\\n<p>It's amazing how hard it is to find a place to ride. I keep thinking that the Internet is an omnipotent source of all truth and knowledge, but there's not much online about riding in Teton Valley. I knew there was a bike path since I'd seen it before and my dad was a part of that project, but other than that it's hard to tune into the local biking scene unless you are a local. (It's the same everywhere I go). I finally found some maps hidden on <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/\\\">Teton Valley Trails and Pathways</a>. They're stowed away under <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/resources/maps\\\">resources -> maps</a>. The one I found most useful is the <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP Cycling Map</a> which listed a couple of rides that looked like they made sense..</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.vrbo.com/331221\\\">We stayed at a great cabin in the middle of the valley just a few miles north of Victor</a>. Since it wasn't far from the bike path that goes from Victor to Driggs I was able to utilize that path the first day and do \\\"The Loop\\\" - a 25 mile loop around the main part of the valley. I normally avoid bike paths when riding at higher speeds since slamming into a pedestrian makes them really mad and there's really not much glory in passing a 5 year old on his BMX. However, in Teton Valley early in the morning the bike path is relatively vacant, and you want to avoid the section of highway it parallels unless you have a lot of life insurance. Between the tourists gawking at the scenery, the locals treating it like the autobahn and the fact there is no shoulder your likely hood of early death.</p>\\n<p>This year the water is high all over the inter-mountain west. We've had plenty of flooding in Cache Valley and Teton Valley has seen similar issues. The entire valley floor is pretty much a giant swamp that collects the run off from the surrounding hills. I was glad for my cross bike on day one while doing the loop since the bike path had become a channel for one of the local creeks. The road across the valley from east to west had low traffic and was fast. I did have to stop to take a picture of a bald eagle: . The <a href=\\\"http://tvtap.org/images/stories/docs/map-tvtap-cycling.pdf\\\">TVTAP cycling map</a> mentions that the west side of the loop has a 2 mile section of gravel road that's not a big deal. I'm sure if you don't love your road bike you can ride it just fine, but I'm pretty fond of my carbon wheels and the paint on my road bike so again the cross bike was a great choice for \\\"The Loop\\\". I cut the ride a bit short and came back across on North Cedron road which is the road where the cabin was. It's downhill from the main road so was able to hit it going 24 plus MPH which was fun until I hit a section of the road where for some reason they decided to dump the remains of a stone quarry. I nearly wiped out when the gravel turned to 3-4\\\" rocks. Callie doesn't like it when I go to the hospital so I dropped my pace and did some swearing. The next section of road was under water, but being a man and all I couldn't let that stop me. I was actually surprised when it didn't and saddened that no one was around to see it. The creek there had cut a channel across the road that was a foot deep which buried the bottom half of my bike in liquid. I'm guessing that's why my power meter doesn't work anymore.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.88429752066116%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0609\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0609-f1c3cd64d7b9419e1ff4f9cccd4e6140-5ae9b.jpg 1936w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>I slept in the next day and so decided I would just do a quick up and down the bike path. It ended up being about 20 miles and I totally left several bmx riding 5 year olds and a couple of old people in the dust. The bike path trip was actually to scout out places to park in Driggs so I could ride Ski Hill road. It felt pretty wussy to drive 8 miles so I could ride my bike, but surprisingly the point of a family trip isn't to avoid the family so I had to keep my rides short. I also checked out the local bike shop <a href=\\\"http://www.peakedsports.com/Home.html\\\">Peaked Sports</a> - sort of anyway. I rode by. I have a history of racking up grounds for divorce credit card bills at bike shops so I thought it best that I look from a distance. They rent bikes so if you don't bring your own you can still ride. Personally I prefer to bring my own stuff. It feels weird to play with other people's equipment.</p>\\n<p>I saved Ski Hill road up to Grand Targee for the last day. After that ride I'm totally ready to buy one of the foreclosed cabins and spend the rest of my days just riding up and down the mountain. This is what it looks like:\\n.\\nIf you are in town for one day do this ride. The pavement is smooth. The road ends at a ski resort so there's not a lot of traffic. The views are spectacular. I get the impression that this is the ride the locals do since I saw quite a few other bikers. I also saw a group of 3 skateboarders coming down the road. I think they were on a suicide mission.</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-9c565.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 74.69135802469135%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"IMG 0614\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-fd4ba.jpg 1950w,\\n/static/IMG_0614-ce9232c55ea13ff3441bdc755341053d-9c565.jpg 2592w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \\n<p>There are a few other rides I want to do but didn't have time.

(It's closed to motors now. When my dad did it they hadn't put a deck on the old rail trestle. He said it was a rush to ride that high up across the railroad ties without any railing.)

A big thanks to <a href=\\\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/advisoryboard/detail.cfm?mem=1110&#x26;group=3&#x26;pid=822\\\">John Pestana</a> for hosting the first party of the BoomStartup program. I can imagine it's a bit stressful to invite 20-30 strangers to your very nice home.</p>\\n<p>I had a great time talking with fellow founders and the mentors and getting a better idea of what they are working on. One conversation stands out in particular. I had a chance to discuss business development and entrepreneurship with <a href=\\\"http://www.johnrichards.me/\\\">John Richards</a>. Our discussion revolved around how entrepreneurs in the technology space create innovative products that result in good paying jobs and how it's important for cities, counties and states to encourage that type of development. Unfortunately, it's all to often easy to try and bring in another Walmart or Home Depot (with their poor wages and lousy benefits) because they bring in immediate revenue via sales taxes.</p>\\n<p>I had a great chance to talk Lego and toy trains with John Pestana. I had assumed he was starting <a href=\\\"http://www.exactrail.com/\\\">ExactRail</a> because once you've hit a home run like Omniture you can do whatever you like and why not build a company aligned with a favorite hobby? I was wrong. Sort of. John likes trains, but his vision for that company in the space is extraordinary and will likely revolutionize how the industry builds and markets trains.</p>\\n<p>The energy in the room was exciting. Everyone there was optimistic about the future and clearly believes that their idea will revolutionize their space. It's fun to hang out in an atmosphere like that.</p>\\n<p>I contrast that with <a href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/05/13/136274980/how-to-create-a-job\\\">a story I heard listening to NPR</a> on the way back to Salt Lake. It was a series of interviews with politicians, business owners, business development organizations and employees. In one of the interviews 5 candidates were interviewed at the same time to determine whether or not they were worthy to make $10/hr (with benefits) to work in a call center. The job sounded terrible. They monitor your every move. If you go to the bathroom you clock out. If you have any down time them how will you fill it to benefit the company. Basically, can we program you and turn you into a human regurgitation machine since customers prefer to talk to a live body. I sensed all creatively being drained from each of this individuals all so they could earn 20k per year.</p>\\n<p>That's not the kind of job growth I envision for this country.</p>\\n<p>Another set of interviews occurred at a business development conference which the interviewer described as a bunch of cordial thieves. Basically, if you are an economic development officer, your job is to lure companies into your area. You usually do this through a combination of sales pitch (our people are awesome) and tax breaks. The only problem with this process is that there are no net jobs created. Once place simple steals jobs from another place.</p>\\n<p>That reminded me of a <a href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/14/startups-or-behemoths-which-are-we-going-to-bet-on/\\\">TechCrunch article from a while back that asked the simple question: who's responsible for job growth, startups or big business</a>? Not surprisingly, according to a <a href=\\\"http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedFiles/firm-formation-inception-8-2-10.pdf\\\">study from the Kauffman foundation</a> the net job creation in this country comes from startups. Big business moves jobs around to take advantage of better tax breaks, etc, but overall they don't really generate a lot of new jobs. That begs the question, why do all of these economic development offices put so much of our tax money into luring companies when they should instead focus on the talent they already have, nurture it, and build new opportunities - the 100k per year jobs instead of the 20k call center sweat shops?</p>\\n<p>I think programs like BoomStartup and similar programs throughout the country focus on what they economic development offices have missed.

Go add a comment and push the request, please.</p>\\n<p>I was using the solution from stackoverflow and it worked well until one day all of the contents of my page vanished upon execution of a method leaving me with a serious WTF at 1 am in the morning.</p>\\n<p>Here's part of my code. I've found that for manipulating an html string jQuery is the bomb. In the code below I take a snippet of html, remove whitespace and then rewrite links.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\tclean_snippet: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/'/gi, \\\"&#40;\\\"); // single quote will cause javascript problems inline.\\n\\t\\tsnippet = snippet.replace(/[\\\\t\\\\n\\\\r]/gi, \\\"\\\"); // remove tabs, newlines, and return chars\\n\\t\\treturn this.rewrite_links(snippet);\\n\\t},\\n\\n\\t// Rewrite links in the snippets so they go back to the parent site.\\n\\trewrite_links: function(snippet){\\n\\t\\tvar obj = jQuery(snippet);\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[href]').attr('href', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.href); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[src]').attr('src', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.src); });\\n\\t\\tobj.find('[action]').attr('action', function(){ return com.oerglue.browser.make_abs_url(this.action); });\\n\\t\\treturn com.oerglue.common.obj_to_s(obj);\\n\\t},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>(Note this code won't work standalone there are some missing methods. It's just here for illustration).</p>\\n<p>When I'm done rewriting links in the html snippet I think convert the jQuery object back into html. I originally used a derivative of the code from the StackOverFlow conversation:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\nobj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n  jQuery('< div>').append(obj.clone()).remove().html();\\n},\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>That works until obj contains script tags which it frequently does when you are dealing with arbitrary html. <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610995/jquery-cant-append-script-element\\\">It turns out that 'append' and all other similar jQuery methods are smart about how they append data and they know to look for script tags</a>.  Because of that when I was appending the object the scripts from the page I'm operating on are re-executed which causes all kinds of nasty problems - see how many web pages can handle the re-execution of bits of javascript from the page. In most cases jQuery is doing what you want. Most of the time when adding new stuff you want the scripts to run. However, when you are building a string you don't want the code to run rather you just want a string representation of the code.</p>\\n<p>I've rewritten my obj<em>to</em>s code to look like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n  obj_to_s : function(obj) {\\n\\t\\tvar tmp = jQuery('<div>');\\n\\t\\tjQuery.each(obj, function(index, item){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(!jQuery.nodeName(item, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttmp.append(item);\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\treturn tmp.html();\\n  },\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I currently ignore scripts when I do the append and now I get a string. I'll post an update when I have a solution for appending the script text.</p>\\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\\n<p>Thanks goes to <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/ryankshaw\\\">Ryan Shaw</a> for helping me work through this. The code below extends jQuery to include an outerHtml method and provides a way to include or exclude scripts.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"javascript\\\">\\n\\njQuery.fn.outerHtml = function(include_scripts) {\\n\\tif(include_scripts === undefined){ include_scripts = false; }\\n\\tvar clone = this.clone();\\n\\tvar items = jQuery.map(clone, function(element){\\n\\t\\tif(jQuery.nodeName(element, \\\"script\\\")){\\n\\t\\t\\tif(include_scripts){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvar attributes;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif(element.attributes){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tattributes = jQuery.map(element.attributes, function(attribute){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    return attribute.name + '=\\\"' + attribute.value + '\\\" ';\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  });\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn '<' + element.nodeName + ' ' + attributes.join(' ') + \\\">\\\" + jQuery(element).html() + \\\"</\\\" + element.nodeName +'>';\\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn '';\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jQuery('<div>').append(element).remove().html();\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t});\\n\\treturn items.join('');\\n}\\n\\n</pre></code>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/817477\\\">Here's the gist on github</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2011-02-08-converting-a-jquery-object-into-a-string/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/converting-a-jquery-object-into-a-string\",\"date\":\"2011-02-08T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Converting a jQuery Object into a String\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Javascript\",\"jQuery\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I love to ride and I have a serious addiction to the gear that I use when I ride.
