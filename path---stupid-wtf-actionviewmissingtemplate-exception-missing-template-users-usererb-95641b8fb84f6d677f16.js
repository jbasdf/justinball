There isn't an _user.json.erb template so Rails tries to find an _user.erb file.  That doesn't exist either and boom you spend the night sounding like a sailor.</p>\n<p>Now I don't pretend to be an expert but I have been accused of being a hack.  I solve the problem by changing the template format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\nformat.json do\n  @template.template_format = :html\n  @user_html = render_to_string( :partial => 'users/user', :object => @user )\n  render :json => { :success => true,\n                              :user_html => @user_html  }\nend\n</pre></code>\n<p>The key is the addition of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n  @template.template_format = :html\n</pre></code>\n<p>Don't yell at me if it breaks.  I'm open to better suggestions but for now this does work and now my I can find other reasons to stay up late.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Stupid WTF!
