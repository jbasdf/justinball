FCC told them to stop.</p>\n<p>Vinton G. Cerf – Not discriminatory access. Everyone can access whatever they like without constraint. This was a part of the fundamental architecture of the internet – you don’t have to negotiate with each provider individually. Problem is that consumers don’t have a choice when it comes to broadband and switching is difficult. The current duopoly and monopolies tend to be anticompetitive. How do regulate that? One side says legislate it. The other side says that is dangers because getting the law right is difficult. It is not appropriate for the broadband provide to take control of the lower layers to control at what happens at the higher layers. Consumer’s right to common and undistorted access should be preserved.</p>\n<p>Robert Pepper – Don’t regulate the internet deal with issues on a case by case basis.</p>\n<p>Vinton G Cerf – I worry about case by case stuff because you have to deal with them one by one. Much more interested in a laying out a framework that spells out legal framework.</p>\n<p>Robert Pepper – double pay is unacceptable. You shouldn’t have to pay for the access and then make Google pay extra to ensure you get decent access to Google. Instead you pay more for a higher class of service. For example, Movielink paid Bell South extra money to give a faster download for their movies on a trial basis. The “free ride” argument is not a legit argument.</p>\n<p>Vinton G Cerf – the ability to let users pay more for faster short term access is perfectly acceptable.</p>\n<p>Both - Preferential treatment for any provider is unacceptable.

Is community a business model or does it need to be bought to have value.</p>\n<p>Caterina Fake - Flickr was about break even when it was acquired. Big competitor was Photolog. Was started as a site for friends to share sites. They did not start as a business so it was hard for them to become a business. Flickr started as a business and as such they took care to design it as a business. Communities that are organic are owned by the community. Value is in the peripheral services.</p>\n<p>Lisa – The community is worth money.</p>\n<p>Jenna – Research of community vs single user. Studies showed ability to recal brands was much greater when engaged in a venue where users where interacting with each other – 4 times greater. Communities come 9 times longer. Stay 5 times longer. Buy more. Spend 35 – 57% more depending on study.</p>\n<p>What makes effective community?</p>\n<p>What is a community killer?\nCaterina Fake – inattention. There needs to be people in there stomping on the trolls. When they started flickr they stayed online and helped out and interacted with each user for about 100 days to build the culture. Decide what you want to permit. What is cool. They mold the commuity.</p>\n<p>Jenna Woodul – agree with Caterina. Brand your community, but let the message be driven by the people in the community</p>\n<p>Jessica Hardwick – Flexibility. Create tools that let some users control their interaction while allowing others to open up to anyone.</p>\n<p>Lisa Stone – don’t lie. Recent example with walmart blog. Walmart hired a couple of journalists who pretended to be a couple of middle age people traveling the country in their RV. They failed to tell users that the users were hired by walmart. Tell the truth.</p>\n<p>How do you grow your community?</p>\n<p>Caterina Fake – running ads all over the internet is a bad way to grow users. Users come via their friends that is the point of a social network. It helps if friends bring in friends. You need an “Abraham” a person or people who “begat” other users and shephard them along. You need key players.\nBefore flickr could setup credit cards they gave away pro accounts to users to give away which made their users look good. Caterina posted on her blog about tea. People made comments. She bought some tea and the company offered a $5 discount to anyone so she got the emails of all the people who posted and emailed them the discount and they loved her. She basically did the companies marketing for them.</p>\n<p>Lisa Stone - You have to be passionate about answering the users questions.</p>\n<p>Jessica Hardwick – wear shirts talk to everyone about the site.</p>\n<p>Monetizing a community</p>\n<p>Jory Des Jardins – turning a community into money has killed many communities.</p>\n<p>Lisa Stone – Asked everyone if they wanted to participate in an ad network. Those who did not want to participate did not have to.</p>\n<p>Jenna Woodul – Corporations are starting communities for many reasons – ads, research about customers, support using peer to peer conversation, others want buzz. When you hold a party you can’t just invite people in and leave them. You need leadership to meet and greet. Those individuals need to carry the culture forward. Trust increases when companies interact with users and allow them to interact even if the comments aren’t positive about the company.</p>\n<p>Jessica Hardwick – Trust within a community. You can’t have a swap transaction without trust that both parties will deliver. Anyone can setup a reputation system. Trust circles or swap circles – people know each other or people know people. Involve users – ask them questions. Users wanted to brand their community. They wanted public and private communities. Reputation is their single most important parameter. People under 18 not allowed. Feedback forms. When launched they built a repuation system. Users asked if they could pull reputation from ebay but they couldn’t. Didn’t like that they were building a closed reputation system. Partnered with rapleaf (<a href="http://www.rapleaf.com/">http://www.rapleaf.com/</a>). They allow users to own their reputation and take it across systems.</p>\n<p>How do you get your first advocates?</p>\n<p>Caterina Fake – Empower users to own some part of your community. Communities tend to take on the characteristics of their founders so be sure to invite people of many backgrounds in. It can be hard to moderate communities when there are many cultures. Flickr had a large users base in Arab countries. In those countries certain pictures of women were not acceptable.</p>\n<p>How do you deal with scale?</p>\n<p>Jenna Woodul – you have to manage new and veteran users. Hopefully, your community leaders do that. In some communities allowing people to have designations based on time in the community is sometimes helpful depending on the culture.</p>\n<p>Tools\nCaterina Fake – build tools that let users expand what you do in ways that you may not currently understand. I hate pre canned community software. They lack identity and tend to be all the same.</p>\n<p>Jessica Hardwick – users kill the spam.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2006-11-07-blogher-presentsworld-domination-via-collaboration/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/blogher-presentsworld-domination-via-collaboration",date:"2006-11-07T07:00:00Z",title:"BlogHer Presents&#8230;World Domination via Collaboration",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"I am attending the Web 2.0 conference this week.

He hadn't been doing well for the past few months, but his passing was still a shock. This kind of funeral leaves you with mixed feelings. I will miss visiting Uncle David on our trips to Idaho to visit my parents, but I have to believe he is happier now than he has been in years. I have often though of my uncle as a modern day Job, only without the happy ending. Years ago he was divorced. Since then his kids haven't been around much. I don't think he got to know his grand kids very well. About 5 years ago he and my dad were up motorcycling. I think they used to do that a lot. David fell and hit his head. For most of us the helmet would be enough to ensure that such a fall would result in a headache and a day of riding cut short. David had arthritis ever since getting home from an LDS mission in Alaska. His neck was weak and the result was a break that left him in the hospital in Salt Lake for 9 months and in a wheel chair the rest of his life. That same arthritis lost him his football scholarship to BYU years ago. He graduated from BYU with a degree in ag economics anyway. I don't know that my grandma Ball ever forgave the cougars for taking away that scholarship.\nDavid was a very strong and active man. He farmed hard and worked hard right up until the accident. I can't remember who told me, but I heard that he could lift a 300-400 lbs disk (tractor implement) into the back of his pickup with ease. Dad showed me one of his rings. I can put two of my fingers in it. He had strength like few men these day have. Not strength polished and engineered in a gym, but power that comes from long hard work done on the land. I have to imagine that being confined to a wheel chair was a personal hell hard to endure.\nMy uncle was not always easy to understand but was brilliant in his own right. He was famous for one liners that made you think and for cowboy poetry. When I had to give a speech at high school graduation he wrote a poem. I will be forever grateful and inspired by his thoughtfulness.\nAbout 6 months ago he eldest child and only son was taken by cancer. Dave couldn't endure a commercial flight, but through the kindness of friends was taken down to California on a personal aircraft so he could see his son a few more times.\nHe was finally taken by pnemonia.\nAt the funeral I learned that he had an old typewriter he used to write a few notes with. He told one of the speakers that he was grateful that one of his fingers was straight so that he could type, one letter at a time.\nJob has nothing on David. I don't know anyone who suffered and endured so much for so long. If I remember the bible story turned out well for Job. I think that for uncle David things will turn out well, just not the way that we often think of as 'well'.\nI tell you this not to make you sad, but so that you can know that a man in a wheel chair can stand tall with unwavering dignity in the face of mounting trials and hardship and he do it with unquestioning faith and gratitude.\nThere aren't many heros left. The people we 'admire' often fail us. No matter how hard my day gets or how hard life seems I will always remember that in the midst of terrible trial and adversity David stayed true to the brand. The world lost a quiet hero last saturday, but with his memory I will always remember to be grateful for what I have and not take for granted the little things that we easily take for granted every day.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2006-10-20-david-ball/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/david-ball",date:"2006-10-20T06:00:00Z",title:"David Ball",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"For 14 years now I have gone motorcycling with my father and brother.

In recent years the opportunity has been reduced to just an annual occurrence. I haven't been very good at keeping track of when or where we go. I know that we have covered miles of high country in southeast and central Idaho, but at this point I couldn't tell you when or where. Mostly I just have good memories of very high places and some wild trails.\nAll of dad's good (funny and scary) biking stories start with, \"don't tell your mom but...\" In that same spirit, don't tell Callie but ...\nWe rode the mountains between Malad pass and Downey today. Before we went I checked Google Earth. There isn't really very much land there - from a satellite. On the ground the world is much different and I learned just how much land lies between the interstate and the state road we take through Preston, Idaho to visit my parents.\nWhen we ride we focus on trails that provide us with the best scenery. None of us are motor cross racers nor do we aspire to be. My wife has to much invested in me and would kill me if I rode anything dangerous. Which is why I start this with don't tell Callie. The loop we rode today seemed tame enough. It wasn't long. None of us checked a topographical map before we went. Big mistake. Today's ride from Cherry Creek Campground was technical. By technical I mean that I am pretty sure that these mountains have claimed lives. It is fall and in recent weeks the clouds have left the area wet. Where we were it left the mountains wet - with snow. A week is usually time enough to let the ground dry, but in the shadow of the mountain (Oxford Peak) the snow melted slowly and unfortunately for us left the thick mountain clay in a state akin to a giant mound of grease. Two foot boulders, 30-35% grades, greasy mud, and stair step tree roots meant that for a good portion of the ride we were forced to push the gas and pray. I personally spent most of the uphill on one wheel - the back one. Wrestling the front one back to the ground proved to be as futile as getting my daughters to clean their room. I kid you not, it was that steep. The rocks and tree roots, added obstacles, did their best to throw us from side to side, and the mud ensured that the bikes went anywhere but up. Dead, fallen trees on the sides of the trails extended ghostly fingers in an attempt to ensure we never left. We were glad for helmets that deterred their attempts and saved us from nasty cuts. If heights weren't enough to deter the adventurous then you are in for a treat. The views are amazing. They come at a cost of water crossings. I am not sure if we need off road stickers for the bikes or boating permits. We crossed more creeks today than the sum of all crossings in my previous 14 years of riding. The epitome was the final 300 yards to the trail head. Remember that we had made a loop and so had no idea what lay ahead. Dad pointed out that he remembered thinking, \"wow and entire day and I didn't get my shoes wet.\" Today being Friday the 13th means that thinking such things is very bad. No sooner had he thought that then the trail dived into the creek. This was not to be a crossing. For 100 yards the trail was the creek. I have no idea who thought of this, but it is a very bad idea. They should be forced to cross it over and over and over again. For 100 yards we muscled bikes over two foot moss covered boulders in an icy stream at 7pm in October. It was like riding on oil, and yes our feet did get wet.\nOverall the trip was a lot of fun if not a bit perilous. Most of the aspen had already lost their leaves - they looked ghost like against the evergreens. Luckily for us in some more sheltered areas, the younger aspen proudly held their color and looked like giant patches of gold against the rugged hillside. Some of travails took us through these groves - a luxury we paid dearly for in the pathways we traveled to see these sites. I don't think we will be going back to the east side of the mountains. I will leave those trails to the insane. Sure people ride, but that is because they are stupid. The west side is pleasant and next year we are going to be sure to ride it in the fall.</p>",
