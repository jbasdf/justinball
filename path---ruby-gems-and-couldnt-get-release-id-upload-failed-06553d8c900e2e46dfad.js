I use a couple of other gems to make the process easier including <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/codeforpeople">rubyforge</a>, <a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/tree/master">jeweler</a> and <a href="http://newgem.rubyforge.org/">newgem</a>.</p>\n<p>Jeweler has a rake task \'rubyforge:release\' that uploads your gem for you. The problem was that it would timeout and give me "Couldn\'t get release_id, upload failed?". I assumed that I had configured something wrong so I tried to upload the file directly to rubyforge. That didn\'t work either so I assumed (wrongly) that my project had something wrong with it. I was about to give up when I decided to check my gem size. It was 100MB!</p>\n<p>Somehow I was packaging the gem inside itself on each release and it had grown into a beast. So if your release is timing out check your gem size and make sure it isn\'t going nuts.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Ruby gems and &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t get release_id, upload failed?&#8221;",date:"May 30, 2009",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
