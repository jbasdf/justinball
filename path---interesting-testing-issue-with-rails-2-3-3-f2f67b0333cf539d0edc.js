I'm using shoulda to do testing and my code looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n    context \"GET show\" do\n      setup do\n        @feed = Factory(:feed)\n        get :show, :id => @feed.to_param\n      end\n      should_not_set_the_flash\n      should_respond_with :success\n      should_render_template :show\n    end\n</pre></code>\n<p>The method I am testing looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n  def show\n    @feed = Feed.find(params[:id])\n    @entries = @feed.entries\n    respond_to do |format|\n      format.pjs { debugger; render :template => 'feeds/show', :layout => false }\n      format.json { render :json => @feed.as_json }\n      format.html { render :template => 'feeds/show', :layout => params[:layout] || true  }\n    end\n  end\n</pre></code>\n<p>The result of running this test is:\n<strong>Missing template feeds/show.erb in view path app/views</strong></p>\n<p>That is very irritating.</p>\n<p>I found that if I change the order as below everything works fine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n  def show\n    @feed = Feed.find(params[:id])\n    @entries = @feed.entries\n    respond_to do |format|\n      format.html { render :template => 'feeds/show', :layout => params[:layout] || true  }\n      format.pjs { debugger; render :template => 'feeds/show', :layout => false }\n      format.json { render :json => @feed.as_json }\n    end\n  end\n</pre></code>\n<p>I can also change the test and explicitly list the format:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n    context \"GET show\" do\n      setup do\n        @feed = Factory(:feed)\n        get :show, :id => @feed.to_param, :format => 'html'\n      end\n      should_not_set_the_flash\n      should_respond_with :success\n      should_render_template :show\n    end\n</pre></code>\n<p>I'm guessing that is the appropriate way to deal with things.  It appears that the test doesn't send in 'html' as a default format.   I might add that this test lives inside a Rails engine.  I'm not sure if that affects things, but I figure that I would list this issue here in case anyone else runs into the same problem or in case I forget how to deal with this which is quite likely.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Interesting testing issue with Rails 2.3.3",date:"July 24, 2009",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/interesting-testing-issue-with-rails-2-3-3"}}}});
