I noticed a rather motley looking group hanging around outside and of course we have to ask the guys in the store what the deal is. I forgot the PS3 comes out this weekend. They are all camped out so they can spend $600 bucks on a game console. The console comes out on fri and the first guy got in line at 7:30 on tues. It is about 30 degrees at night in Cache Valley. Now I can understand if your best buddies kid is in the hospital and needs a pick me up it might be worth the sacrifice. Most of these guys plan to ebay them for about $2300. That's about $1700 in profit. Not bad, except many of them took the week off work to do it. So assume that you make $10 an hour. You'll make about $400 in a week which takes the take down to $1300. Still not bad, but you have to freeze your butt off and stink. Plus you have to sit there. Now be creative. Find something else to sell on ebay. I have friends and family that do that. So figure that you can list 5 items in an hour. That should include the packing and shipping when the order comes in. That means you could list about 200 items in a week. There is software that would help you do that as well. Let's say you make $10 bucks an item. That isn't to hard to do.

The speakers were basically an overwhelming mix of CEOs and whos who from every major Internet player. It was exciting to hear them all and to sit next to all kinds of really \"important\" people.</p>\n<p>A guy from Intel who was there looking for new hot companies and new trends asked me what I thought was missing. I have thought about that as it is probably the one meaningful question I was asked the entire conference. (Most people just ask conversational questions. Probably because they don't really care what I think.) The question he asked was what I thought was missing. Frankly, the thing missing from the conference was the next big thing. There were lots of small venture funded and self funded companies, but I wonder if the next really big, important company can, at this point, pay $3400 to smooze with the big boys. I wonder if the next big thing wasn't across the bay at the Ruby on Rails session a couple of guys were putting on, or tucked away with a couple of developers in a small office or someone's basement.</p>\n<p>The conference was defined by who was there, but I think that the people who weren't there indicate what Web 2.0 is to those who coined the term. Zillow wasn't there. I didn't see anyone from 30 Boxes. The 37 signals guys were not there although Jeff Bezos did say he looked forward to \"working with them.\" I didn't see Last.fm or Pandora. I don't know that StumbleUpon was there either. I saw SuprGlu show up on a slide, but I would bet those guys wouldn't have the resources to blow to come to the smooze fest. Meebo lacks many of the Web 2.0 features, but I think you would have a hard time arguing that it isn't Web 2.0</p>\n<p>There were Microsoft people and Intel and Amazon and Yahoo and Google and lots of others that my Mom would easily recognize. That is telling. The big boys are afraid of what the next generation of software will bring, but the irony is that they probably crowded out the people that they should fear the most - those guys figuring out how to do something cheap, fast and without the suits.</p>\n<p>One other thought. Every time a group forms <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/11/web_20_principl_1.html\">they expend a lot of time and energy trying to define themselves</a>. Personally I think that Web 2.0 is defined by something John Battelle said on stage. He said that the he and Tim O'Reilly started the conference after the dot come bust to add life back into the Internet world. They correctly realized that the web was not dead and wanted people to know that. The \"Web 2.0\" companies are all over the place. I don't think they are defined by the technology use nor by the principles they implement. Personally I think that Web 2.0 is defined by that first conference and by Monty Python. \"We're not dead yet.\"</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2006-11-10-web-20-conference-after-thoughts/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/web-20-conference-after-thoughts",date:"2006-11-10T07:00:00Z",title:"Web 2.0 Conference After Thoughts",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Jim Buckmaster (CEO Craigslist)\nWe manage with only 20 peope by relying on our users to manage what goes on on the site.

There is growth the in the 35 plus demographic because the entire world wants to be creative. They are focused on specific vertical markets – trails.com. Demand Media is a bottom up company. Let users figure out the community. Provide them the tools. Raised 220 million dollars for this new company. Bought nine companies. Demand Media runs www.trails.com, www.ehow.com, and www.wehow.com as well as others, a total of nine that they purchased with the 220 million.\nMyspace success - spend no money on marketing. Instead take that money and put it into feature developments that users requested. That is their form of marketing. Tom still reviews each feature.\nProvide the best tools and technologies to let people express themselves. Make it easy for them to interact with professional content. Need to provide a place where the negative stuff doesn’t get so large that users don’t feel safe.</p>\n<p>Toni Schneider (WordPress.com, Automattic)\nTook a little VC money. Focused on users and doing what they tell us. Turn users into contributors. Take principles of open source and apply them to the company. Doesn’t like the term user generated content because it doesn’t describe everything. Collective intelligence is not User Generated Content. For example, Akismet – anti spam product meant to keep spam off of blogs and wikis. Akismet sees spam across hundreds of thousands of blogs and learns. It harnesses that collective intelligence to reduce the spam problem. Opening up helped bring more users. Companies need to open up and do what is hard – give up control. Your users will generate content of very high quality. They turned translation over to their users. It took 24 hours for them to translate into German. There were few errors and only one goofy string of some guy announcing his wedding.</p>\n<p>Owen Van Natta (Chairman Facebook)\nMark has a very user centric view of the world.

Google figured out how to make money from search results and now they believe they have the algorithms needed to make money from video. I am not sure what that means. They did aquire a company not long ago that recognizes people in pictures. Perhaps they plan on applying that to video? Google has the servers to process that kind of data.</p>\n<p>Schmit stated that Google tries to respect end users first rather than fall prey to business models that might hurt their users. He felt that that was they way to keep your users from hating you in the way that some people have grown to loathe Microsoft. He was applauded for Google’s refusal to turn over data to the defense department, however he also stated that Google is subject to the laws of the United States and that they would comply current laws and with any orders given by a federal judge. I am a negative person in general but after he said that it made me wonder if they had been ordered by some judge to turn something over and the public was not ever made aware of it. Lovely times we live in when stuff like that is done in the dark.</p>\n<p>“Don’t bet against the Internet,” was one of Schmit’s more interesting quotes. He said that the Internet is about sharing and businesses that don’t share won’t do well. A lot of the conference has been about being open with APIs and data but not for altruistic reasons. Everyone who talked about openness did so in the context of how it made or is going to make them more money. Not the best motivation, but it is nice to know that what we have believed at COSL for years is also sustainable.</p>\n<p>Schmit compared service based software with packaged software by saying your money works better for you in the bank than in your pocket. I’m not sure the analogy works, but he is smarter than me. His point was that service based software has to work 24/7. If it doesn’t 1 million users start blogging about it or emailing you about it. Packaged software leaves the consumer all alone to deal with the problem by themselves or to wait for a patch that may be months in coming. He said that it is “fundamentally better” to get a data center to manage your applications and data. However, he also said that Google’s online applications are not meant to replace and office sweet but are instead intended for casual users. “We run the company around solving needs for end users.” I don’t think the audience believed him though. Most seemed to lean towards the belief that the Google tools sweet is meant to compete against Office whether they will ever admit it is questionable.</p>\n<p>Someone asked Schmit how they retain employees. He said, “People don’t work for money they work for impact.” I agree. At COSL we work for impact. Most everyone there could make more somewhere else. However, at Google I’m sure that becoming a gazillionare via stock options probably helps retention quite a bit.</p>\n<p>Joichi Ito flew in from Japan to show the audience World of Warcraft for ten minutes. He said games are becoming a normal part of our physical world and said, “we are not strange.” I disagree. Everyone at this conference is strange. These are not normal people. They are all CTO or CEO of something – even if there are only three employees, or else they are a VC looking to fund a company whose CEO is also the janitor.</p>\n<p>Six apart showed off vox which is a system for sharing stuff you are already creating. Sounded like ozmozr until he showed the demo. We do similar things, but are different. They developed a platform called “Open Media Profile” that integrates GData, Open Search, and MediaRSS. White paper is at developers.sixapart.com.</p>\n<p>Jack Ma from China was interviewed by John Hileman and talked about alibaba.com. Yahoo gave him a billion dollars for 40% of his company and then turned Yahoo China over to him. Two quotes from Jack, “I want to influence others not have others influence me.” Also, Hileman, “will you be invading the US markets anytime soon?” Jack, “what do you mean invading? I come to help.” Jack’s company is killing eBay in China. There was a rumor that eBay bought Skype in response to what Jack is doing with his version of eBay in China, but that “theory” was dispelled by Niklas Zennstrom, Skype CEO and founder in the evening conversation.</p>\n<p>The other conversation was between Barry Diller() and Arthur Sulzberger Jr (NYTimes) and facilitated by John Battelle. I don’t’ think they have a lot of love for each other. Barry stated that there are a very limited number of people who can write in a way that appeals to a mass audience and Sulzberger of course agreed. Sulzberger slipped and said that there are 550k subscribers behind the NYTimes paywall. He tried to rephrase by saying if it was a newspaper it would be their third largest behind the NYTimes and Boston Globe.</p>",

This conference is a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>Jeff Bezos is up now. Here are some Amazon stats:\n61 million accounts, 10 billion in sales, seven countries, 1.1 million active seller accounts, 10 million square feet in fulfillment space.</p>\n<p>Here are the more interesting stats:\n200,000 register developers. 10 different web offerings. S3 let’s you store your crap very cheaply and easily. EC2 is a new offering - computers in the cloud. Costs about 70 bucks a month for the equivalent of your own server. This is an interesting offering that the CEO from smugmug.com and the creator of tickle.com raved about last night at dinner. This is a utility that lets small companies get access to powerful computing clusters that scale quickly. It also means that developers no longer have to worry about any of the IT issues that you typically deal with. Bezos calls it “muck.” It is all the crap you have to do that distracts from your core ideas. This is very cool. It makes me wonder if there is any chance Google would do the same thing since they have also figured out large scale clustered computing.</p>\n<p>So why do this? “Why is a really good question. We’ve been doing this for eleven years. For several years we’ve been working on this services.” He said that he thinks web 2.0 is computers talking to computers. That is a definition I have not heard. Most people will tell you web 2.0 is user centric applications. “We doing this because we are good at it” and he said he thinks it will turn a profit and “why not?”</p>\n<p>Amazon has a custom fulfillment center. Users can send items to their fulfillment center network. You send stuff to them. They will sell it and they will fulfill the order. This allows developers to write software that treats Amazon’s huge fulfillment centers as a peripheral like a printer. You write the code and it uses Amazon to send/receive your products.</p>\n<p>For Amazon “the biggest cost is lack of utilization.” Amazon wants to use those assets to make money so they let others use their stuff.
