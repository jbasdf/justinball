As part of what we do at COSL we have <a href="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/brian/">Brian Lamb</a> helping us out with research. As we searched for good research questions our we had to ask ourselves if the questions had already been asked which means that we started down a literature review process. In order to help facilitate (now that sounds academic) this process we built a <a href="http://www.gistr.com/">new website called gistr</a>. It is still spartan, but the idea is that as you find interesting papers you share the "gist" of the paper with the rest of the world. One paper can have as many "gists" as the reader thinks is reasonable and of course you can tag the gist.</p>\n<p>The plan is to add features that allow users to save off gists and maybe even generate a bibliography from that group. This process should make it easier to create the lit review part of any paper.</p>\n<p>Also, it should help researchers who use similar tags find one another and share findings (gists). It isn\'t much to look at yet, but you can look forward to upcoming improvements.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"New Website for Academic Types",date:"June 21, 2007",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/new-website-for-academic-types"}}}});
