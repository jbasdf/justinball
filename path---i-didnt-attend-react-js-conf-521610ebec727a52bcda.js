Jimmy Buffet once said, "I can go to movies and see it all there just the way that it used to be..." \nThanks to the all this modern technology life is even better than it used to be.\nNow I can just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr">go to YouTube and watch all of React.js conf 2015</a> \nwhile sitting here in my underwear. I don\'t recommend going to the movies and doing that.</p>\n<p>The very fact that the conference sold out in seconds says something about the popularity of <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>. \nIn case you\'re like me and also missed out you can get all the videos from \n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr">the React.js Conf YouTube play list</a>.\nIf you don\'t have all day to watch them all here are the highlights that I think are worth spending 25 minutes (each) watching. You know you have\ntime. Just stop checking Facebook in the bathroom and pull up these little snippets of wisdom instead.\n</p>\n<h3>React.js Native</h3>\n<p>The big news, React.js has gone native. You can build compiled applications for iOS and Android using React.js. It\'s all part of a "Learn once write everywhere"\nphilosophy being adopted at Facebook. In case you are tired of learning every new language and platform that comes along this will be a welcome relief.\nIf you want to see a bit of code Ryan Florence (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">@ryanflorence</a>)\n<a href="https://gist.github.com/ryanflorence/080976e21b77eb80ff8f">posted a gist</a> of a checklist app and \n<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0o6pa3jdsueeovc/react-native-editing.mp4?dl=0">here\'s 30 seconds of him changing text in the demo movie app</a>.\n</p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rDsRXj9-cU?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>Relay</h3>\n<p>Relay looks like it will solve world peace. At the very least I\'ll probably do a lot less swearing at my computer once this is open source. There\'s no\ncode yet but Greg Hurrell (<a href="https://twitter.com/wincent">@wincent</a>) put together <a href="https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf47">\na gist that answers all your basic Relay questions</a>. Relay will impact your Flux and Router code.</p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sc8Pyc51uU" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>Immutable Data</h3>\n<p>No longer the stuff of stuffy academics, immutable data can have a real life inside your application and make you more productive.\n<a href="https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js">Check out the open source immutable.js code</a> and learn more from \nLee Byron(<a href="https://twitter.com/leeb">@leeb</a>). If you want more Om, <a href="http://swannodette.github.io/">David Nolan</a> \n(<a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">@swannodette</a>) and immutable data\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYRxaDweTODXHlZaGvUq3MRykRnbRzBim">here\'s a YouTube playlist</a>.\n</p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7IdS-PbEgI?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>Fixed Data Table</h3>\n<p>I like presentations that are backed by code - especially open source code that you can use in your application right now. \nJason Bonta (<a href="https://github.com/jbonta">jbonta</a>) did a great job\nexplaining how they built a data table in React.js that can handle an insane amount of data without making your browser cry.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table">Here\'s the open source repo for Fixed Data Table.</a> </li>\n  <li><a href="http://www.reactbook.org/blog/fixed-data-table-reactjs.html">Here\'s a review/intro of the fixed data table from reactbook.org.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYzlpRvWZ6c?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>React.js Router</h3>\n<p>Complex client side application must have a router. Urls are important. Don\'t break the web and don\'t piss off your users. \nMichael Jackson (<a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson">@mjackson</a>) and Ryan Florence (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">@ryanflorence</a>) and the \ncommunity have done a great job producing a much needed piece of the React.js application infrastructure. I think the React Router is more important in what\nit represents than in what it does. All the big pieces of React - React itself, flux, the data table, Relay, React Native, etc have come from Facebook. That\'s\ngreat because it means the code has been battle tested with millions of users. However, the router reprents buy in from the open source community. There are\ndevelopers not at Facebook willing to spend their time and brain cycles building a piece of software and a community. Community is key to the learn turn\nsustainability of any open source project. </p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZfvW1a8Xac?list=PLYRxaDweTODWcfe6V7XMPn40pE6iNd9ij" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>react-intl</h3>\n<p>At some point you will be asked to make your application work in a language other than English. On that day you are going to be greatful for \n<a href="http://formatjs.io/">format.js</a></p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sla-DkvmIHY?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>React.js Code</h3>\n<p>We are developers. We speak code. It\'s nice to see concrete examples. Ryan Florence (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">@ryanflorence</a>) demonstrates\n<a href="https://github.com/ryanflorence/reactconf-2015-HYPE">everything from performance to magic to accessibility to building an isomorphic application</a>.\nIf you want to add accessiblity to your React.js application (and you should) you can check out the tool that Ryan showed off here\n<a href="http://react.rocks/example/react-a11y">react-a11y</a>.</p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5e7kWSHWTg?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<h3>Interestingness from Twitter</h3>\n<p>During the conference I saw a few tweets show up with #reactjsconf that looked interesting:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href="http://chantastic.io/2015-reactjs-conf/">Michael Chan\'s beautiful and awesome conference notes.</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/chantastic">@chantastic</a>)</li>\n  <li><a href="https://egghead.io/series/react-fundamentals">React.js Fundamentals from Egghead.io</a> is worth watching if you are new to React.js</li>\n  <li><a href="https://github.com/justin808/react-webpack-rails-tutorial">Here\'s a React.js, Webpack.js in Rails tutorial</a></li>\n  <li><a href="https://github.com/elierotenberg/nexus-flux-socket.io">Flux over socket.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other React.js Goodness</h3>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/01/27/react-v0.13.0-beta-1.html">\n  In React 0.13.0 you no longer need to use React.createClass instead you can use ES6 classes today\n</a>. This news does kill mixins, but we love ES6 so I don\'t really care that much.</p>\n<p>One more presentation, not given at React.js conf that is just really good which you should watch\nSteven Luscher(<a href="https://twitter.com/steveluscher">@steveluscher</a>) "Decomplexifying Code with React".</p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rI0GQc__0SM?list=PLYRxaDweTODWcfe6V7XMPn40pE6iNd9ij" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>',frontmatter:{title:"I Didn't Attend React.js Conf",date:"February 02, 2015",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/i-didn't-attend-react.js-conf"}}}});
