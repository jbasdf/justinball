The Clearance guys added a file in config/initializers that looks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n# This simulates loading the clearance gem, but without relying on\\n# vendor/gems\\n\\nclearance_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), *%w(.. .. .. ..))\\nclearance_lib_path = File.join(clearance_path, \\\"lib\\\")\\n\\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift(clearance_lib_path)\\nload File.join(clearance_path, 'rails', 'init.rb')\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I thought that was brilliant but it didn't work for me.  After messing around in the Rails code for a bit I found a bit of helpful documentation on 'plugin_locators':</p>\\n<i>\\nThe classes that handle finding the desired plugins that youâ€˜d like to load for your application. By default it is the Rails::Plugin::FileSystemLocator which finds plugins to load in vendor/plugins. You can hook into gem location by subclassing Rails::Plugin::Locator and adding it onto the list of plugin_locators.\\n</i>\\n<p>That sounded like the perfect solution to my problem.  I figured I would simply add a plugin locator that pointed to the root of the gem I was building.  Turns out that works great.  In the embedded rails application inside of config/environment.rb I added this code:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass TestGemLocator < Rails::Plugin::Locator\\n  def plugins\\n    Rails::Plugin.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), *%w(.. .. ..)))\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nRails::Initializer.run do |config|\\n  config.time_zone = 'UTC'\\n  config.plugin_locators << TestGemLocator\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Now my tests load correctly and all is well.

You need a task to copy the production database to your local machine? It's already done.</p>\\n<p>More recently I've started using <a href=\\\"http://www.engineyard.com/solo\\\">Solo</a> to host <a href=\\\"http://www.genlighten.com\\\">Genlighten</a> (more to come on Genlighten soon). Solo sits on top of Amazon's ec2 service. You might ask why you should pay more for EngineYard's stack when you can just use Amazon's services. That's a good question. Although Solo doesn't come with the same level of support as the main EngineYard product you will find Ezra (vice president) answering questions in the support form. You can get answers to your questions in just a few minutes in the IRC channel. Need to deploy a new Rails application? It takes just a few minutes to provision a new instance and have a full stack up and running.</p>\\n<p>As a side note they are a sponsor at the <a href=\\\"http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2009/\\\">Mountain West Ruby Conference</a>.

It turns out that turning gems into plugins is pretty easy to do.  However, testing them can be a pain.  Here are a few things I came up with.</p>\\n<p>After looking at how <a href=\\\"http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2009/2/9/clearance-rails-authentication-for-developers-who-write-tests\\\">Clearance</a> handles tests I've decided that it's ok to embed a basic Rails application in your test directory.</p>\\n<p>The next trick is getting the gem you are working on to load in your embedded Rails application.  The Clearance guys added a file in config/initializers that looks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n# This simulates loading the clearance gem, but without relying on\\n# vendor/gems\\n\\nclearance_path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), *%w(.. .. .. ..))\\nclearance_lib_path = File.join(clearance_path, \\\"lib\\\")\\n\\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift(clearance_lib_path)\\nload File.join(clearance_path, 'rails', 'init.rb')\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I thought that was brilliant but it didn't work for me.  After messing around in the Rails code for a bit I found a bit of helpful documentation on 'plugin_locators':</p>\\n<i>\\nThe classes that handle finding the desired plugins that youâ€˜d like to load for your application. By default it is the Rails::Plugin::FileSystemLocator which finds plugins to load in vendor/plugins. You can hook into gem location by subclassing Rails::Plugin::Locator and adding it onto the list of plugin_locators.\\n</i>\\n<p>That sounded like the perfect solution to my problem.  I figured I would simply add a plugin locator that pointed to the root of the gem I was building.  Turns out that works great.  In the embedded rails application inside of config/environment.rb I added this code:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass TestGemLocator < Rails::Plugin::Locator\\n  def plugins\\n    Rails::Plugin.new(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), *%w(.. .. ..)))\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nRails::Initializer.run do |config|\\n  config.time_zone = 'UTC'\\n  config.plugin_locators << TestGemLocator\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Now my tests load correctly and all is well.  Context is important.

I've worked with Teachers Without Borders for more than a year now. I was granted a fellowship that allowed me to work with them to build a social network that will help teachers world-wide. Like any developer that has poured a lot of time into a project I have mixed feelings about passing the project onto another group. On the one hand it is a relief since maintenance of the project can be stressful. On the other hand not having to worry about making sure the site is running from day to day reduces a large burden.</p>\\n<p>I was talking to my wife the other day about the situations my mother-in-law, a first grade teacher, has seen over the years. In this modern age of consumerism it is easy to forget that there are many in dire circumstances. We think that the problem is out there, in Africa, in Asia, somewhere else. The truth is in this 'great nation' kids still come to school in the winter without coats. Parents neglect their children - don't wash their clothes, don't feed them, and even abandon them. Our future is also our most vulnerable population.</p>\\n<p>Most of the time I feel pretty powerless to make any significant different, but working with Teachers Without Borders has given me the opportunity to hopefully contribute in some small but meaningful way.</p>\\n<p>Teachers are treated poorly. Parents love to complain but rarely praise their efforts. They deal with salaries that are a pittance compared to what they are worth (think of what a difference a teacher makes versus the latest crop of CEOs and ask yourself who has done more and deserves better).</p>\\n<p>My thanks goes to all the teachers who have made such a difference in my life and to all those around the world who are trying to make this planet a better place.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2009-04-15-teachers-without-borders-2/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/teachers-without-borders-2\",\"date\":\"2009-04-15T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Teachers Without Borders\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been a pallbearer a number of times over the years.
