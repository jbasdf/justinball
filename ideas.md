Travel cheap with credit card points
I've been reducing my travel costs significantly using credit card points the last few years and so I get a lot of questions about how to do. This last year I took my family of 7 to Washington DC for spring break. It was our cheapest family trip ever since the only thing we had to pay for was food and metro. I think it cost less than $1,000 including souvenirs and the few trips we did have to pay for. I and my wife then spent a week at the Ritz Carlton on Hawaii. We had to pay for food, activities and a rental car but the hotel and flights were once again free. We even managed to use a couple of the airport lounges on the way.

The catch is that you have to have decent credit, be willing to get new credit cards, spend a certain amount on those credit cards and be able to pay them off. If you run up a bunch of debt then earning points will be pointless. You will also run into credit card fees. In most cases I've found the fees are worth the benefit. You'll have to decide yourself if they are worth it.

Here are the cards that I've used. I've also indicated whether they are worth keeping.

How to teach your kids (or you) to code (or anything else for that matter) for free
The best place to start is Khan Academy. I just did this with all my kids. Have your child sign up for an account. Khan Academy will then ask them what grade they are in and have them select subjects. Pick some. In particular pick the computer science ones

Your next stop should be Udemy. If the courses cost more than $10 then stop and wait. Give them a month or so and the courses will go on sale for $10.
