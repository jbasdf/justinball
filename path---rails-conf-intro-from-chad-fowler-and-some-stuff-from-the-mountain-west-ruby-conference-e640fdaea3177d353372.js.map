I think he works on giving keynotes that leave you scratching your head a bit. His keynote at the Mountain West Ruby conference had mixed reviews. We left wondering what his intent was, but we weren’t sure if it was just our perception. Last night we had a chance to meet up with some of the people who were at the conference. They commented that they had a similar “huh?” moments during Fowler’s keynote. One of the guys brought his chief Java architect hoping to persuade him over to Ruby. After the talk the architects comments were, \\\"so Ruby is slow, we shouldn't deploy on it, and you should be moving on to Haskell or Erlang anyway.\\\" I think that several people, especially the guys new to Ruby, got the impression that they were newbs polluting the Ruby world. These were the assembly programmers who weren't smart enough to jump sooner. How dare they stay in .Net, Php, or Java for so long. These guys of course are the same one who didn't spend their nights hacking and so missed out and according to Fowler should be looking for jobs at fast food restaurants or the like. This was a Ruby keynote? One guy in the group has watched the keynote a number of times. His take away was different.
