Aubrey is the one that does what she is supposed to. Any time there is a reward system she gets the most of whatever it is. Currently, we are giving stars to the kids and when they fill up a chart they get to do something fun like get ice cream etc. Aubrey\'s is almost full. Alyssa is lucky to have a couple of stars on hers.</p>\n<p>So the other night I come down stairs. Aubrey, having just taken care of her dishes and finished putting her pajamas on received a couple more stars.</p>\n<p>Alyssa was bawling. It was very sad, but I still laugh. "I am always bad. I don\'t even know how to be good, " Alyssa was throwing a tantrum. Aubrey in the mean time sat on her bed mocking her sister saying, "bla bla bla bla, bla bla bla bla" over and over again whilst Alyssa is in a very dramatic moment of depression.</p>\n<p>The humor is that they take such great pleasure in torturing each other. I guess that is sad too.</p>\n<p>I am sitting here now.</p>\n<p>Aubrey is getting punished - Callie is taking some of her money away. Alyssa\'s response?
