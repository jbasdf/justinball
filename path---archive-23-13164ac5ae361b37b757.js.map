No one will remember to keep submitting it anyway and since your entries in the products section of Google Base can expire it is important that you continually resubmit your products.</p>\\n<p>So I wrote a class to handle the Google Base stuff and then I put it into a Windows Service.  I figured as long as I was at it I would also write a service that can write out our site maps at the same time.</p>\\n<p>The site maps service starts fine.  The Google Base service starts then dies and drops this in the logs:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nEventType clr20r3, P1 r3b0434webwhcosy0o40t3c1xyqmvmpy, P2 1.0.0.0, P3 47803796, P4\\ntheplancollectionbackgroundservices, P5 1.0.0.0, P6 47803796, P7 16, P8 3e, P9 system.io.filenotfoundexception, P10 NIL.\\n\\nFor more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Since that message is so very helpful the problem is miserable to solve.

In my case I first ran the Windows Update to ensure I had the latest .Net framework.  I read that that helped others.  It didn't seem to make a difference.  I am using the Google Base .Net api.  I figured that I had spent enough of the day trying new vulgarities so I ran the SDK installer on the server.  Like magic my service now works.  I don't usually like to run SDK installers on servers so I then removed it and figured that I might need to install the one dll that I am using into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  I didn't.  The service still runs just fine.  The installer must leave something behind that keeps let's the service run.  I am betting there is some registry configuration somewhere that was changed and not reverted.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the most frustrating parts of development.  I would say it is because Windows is terrible or something, but all OSs share this same problem.  On Windows it is the registry on Linux it is dependency hell and on the Mac they pretend to be *nix so a lot of stuff works, but then right when you think you have that latest package ready to compile you find out that the smart boys at Apple decided to change the way something functions or they decided it would be OK to move things around.</p>\\n<p>Computers are painful.

She was a bit more excited about it than Aubrey and would even show it to us. Aubrey wouldn't hear of showing her second loose tooth to anyway.</p>\\n<p>Given Alyssa's excitement I thought she wouldn't mind having her tooth pulled out. It has been loose for weeks and the new tooth is growing in. Not a chance. I tickled her and held her down until she cried. It didn't even take a yank. It came right out bled for a couple of minutes and she was fine.</p>\\n<p>Aubrey knew what I was doing and ran and hid.</p>\\n<p>For her pulling a tooth was more like preparing for your last meal or like getting ready for heart surgery. She cried a lot. You have to feel bad for her. She thought she would look 'crazy' and that it would hurt. I doubt the thought of all that blood helped much either. In the end Callie pulled it right out while I held her.</p>\\n<p>Pulling teeth isn't really that hard. They come out pretty easy if it is time for them to come out. Convincing my kids that the teeth need to come out is the hard part. I think it is like that for many of us.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-12-16-its-like-pulling-teeth/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/its-like-pulling-teeth\",\"date\":\"2007-12-16T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"It&#8217;s Like Pulling Teeth\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"Cycling is an interesting individual sport that requires teams.

Free hosting with one of the premier Ruby on Rails hosts.  I normally have to eat bags of M&#x26;Ms to be this happy.</p>\\n<p>Not all is roses.  There is a dark side to this free hosting.  Setting it up will make you want to cry.  I am a developer, not a Solaris system administrator and so getting my application deployed was like having a vasectomy and being totally conscious the entire time.  In hopes of saving time in the future for myself and others here is how to configure your Facebook Rails application for deployment via Capistrano on a Joyent Accelerator.  The ideas aren't mine.  I stole everything from all over the place.  I added links at the bottom where I found some of the information.  The rest of it I will just feel guilty about.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li> <a href=\\\"http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=12629\\\">Setup your shell for capistrano</a>.  Follow the link for the how and why.\\n   Note my $HOME/.ssh/environment file contains this:\\n    <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/ucb:\\n/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/sbin:\\n/opt/csw/gnu:/opt/csw/gcc3/bin:/opt/csw/mysql5/bin:\\n/opt/csw/postgresql/bin:/opt/csw/apache2/bin:\\n/opt/csw/apache2/sbin\\n</pre></code>\\n  Also be careful so that you don't edit ssh_config instead of sshd_config not that anyone would ever be so stupid and do that.  :-)\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  Make sure you have the Capistrano gem installed on your local machine:\\n  <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">sudo gem install capistrano</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  capify your application:\\n   In the root of your rails application run this:\\n   <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">capify .</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  You will now have a deploy.rb in your config directory.  Replace it with this <a href='http://www.justinball.comdeploy.rb' title='deploy.rb'>deploy.rb</a>.\\nThen be sure to replace the XXXXXXXX with the username provided to you in your welcome email from Joyent.  Then look for the sections of deploy.rb that contain capital letters and enter in the relevant values.  These will include your application name, your domain name, and the path to your repository.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow create a directory inside your config directory and name accelerator.  Then add the following three files into it:\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comaccelerator_tasks.rb' title='accelerator_tasks.rb'>accelerator_tasks.rb - contains Capistrano recipes specific to the Joyent Accelerator.</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comapache_vhost.erb' title='apache_vhost.erb'>apache_vhost.erb - configures apache to point to your rails application</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comsmf_template.erb' title='smf_template.erb'>smf_template.erb - starts up mongrel automatically for you when you system starts</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow we need a mongrel_cluster.yml file.  Create a file called mongrel_cluster.yml inside of your config directory and put this in it:\\nport: \\\"8000\\\"\\nenvironment: production\\naddress: 127.0.0.1\\npid_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/pids/mongrel.pid\\nlog_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/log/mongrel.log\\nservers: 3\\ndocroot: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current/public\\ncwd: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current\\n<p>You will need to edit the paths to match the paths you setup in deploy.rb.  This likely means that you will need to replace XXXXXXX with your joyent username and APP-NAME with the name of your application.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nSubversion needs to know how to talk to your repository if it is password protected.  ssh into the server and do this inside your home directory:\\nsvn co PATH TO YOUR PROJECT\\nYou can delete the directory when it is done.  You do this so that your svn username and password are cached on the server which means that Capistrano will be able to checkout files.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nWhile you are logged into the server be sure to create an empty database.  The name should match the name in your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nBe sure to enter the proper username for root into your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow for the exciting part:\\nRun <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">cap deploy:setup</pre></code> inside of the root of your Rails project.  It should run successfully.  If not I am very sorry.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nThen do this:\\ncap deploy:cold\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\nYou should be up and running at that point.\\n<p>More helps and information:\\n<a href=\\\"http://wiki.joyent.com/facebook:kb:faststart\\\">Joyent's quickstart</a>.

No one will remember to keep submitting it anyway and since your entries in the products section of Google Base can expire it is important that you continually resubmit your products.</p>\\n<p>So I wrote a class to handle the Google Base stuff and then I put it into a Windows Service.  I figured as long as I was at it I would also write a service that can write out our site maps at the same time.</p>\\n<p>The site maps service starts fine.  The Google Base service starts then dies and drops this in the logs:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nEventType clr20r3, P1 r3b0434webwhcosy0o40t3c1xyqmvmpy, P2 1.0.0.0, P3 47803796, P4\\ntheplancollectionbackgroundservices, P5 1.0.0.0, P6 47803796, P7 16, P8 3e, P9 system.io.filenotfoundexception, P10 NIL.\\n\\nFor more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Since that message is so very helpful the problem is miserable to solve.

In my case I first ran the Windows Update to ensure I had the latest .Net framework.  I read that that helped others.  It didn't seem to make a difference.  I am using the Google Base .Net api.  I figured that I had spent enough of the day trying new vulgarities so I ran the SDK installer on the server.  Like magic my service now works.  I don't usually like to run SDK installers on servers so I then removed it and figured that I might need to install the one dll that I am using into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  I didn't.  The service still runs just fine.  The installer must leave something behind that keeps let's the service run.  I am betting there is some registry configuration somewhere that was changed and not reverted.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the most frustrating parts of development.  I would say it is because Windows is terrible or something, but all OSs share this same problem.  On Windows it is the registry on Linux it is dependency hell and on the Mac they pretend to be *nix so a lot of stuff works, but then right when you think you have that latest package ready to compile you find out that the smart boys at Apple decided to change the way something functions or they decided it would be OK to move things around.</p>\\n<p>Computers are painful.

Setting it up will make you want to cry.  I am a developer, not a Solaris system administrator and so getting my application deployed was like having a vasectomy and being totally conscious the entire time.  In hopes of saving time in the future for myself and others here is how to configure your Facebook Rails application for deployment via Capistrano on a Joyent Accelerator.  The ideas aren't mine.  I stole everything from all over the place.  I added links at the bottom where I found some of the information.  The rest of it I will just feel guilty about.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li> <a href=\\\"http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=12629\\\">Setup your shell for capistrano</a>.  Follow the link for the how and why.\\n   Note my $HOME/.ssh/environment file contains this:\\n    <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/ucb:\\n/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/sbin:\\n/opt/csw/gnu:/opt/csw/gcc3/bin:/opt/csw/mysql5/bin:\\n/opt/csw/postgresql/bin:/opt/csw/apache2/bin:\\n/opt/csw/apache2/sbin\\n</pre></code>\\n  Also be careful so that you don't edit ssh_config instead of sshd_config not that anyone would ever be so stupid and do that.  :-)\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  Make sure you have the Capistrano gem installed on your local machine:\\n  <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">sudo gem install capistrano</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  capify your application:\\n   In the root of your rails application run this:\\n   <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">capify .</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  You will now have a deploy.rb in your config directory.  Replace it with this <a href='http://www.justinball.comdeploy.rb' title='deploy.rb'>deploy.rb</a>.\\nThen be sure to replace the XXXXXXXX with the username provided to you in your welcome email from Joyent.  Then look for the sections of deploy.rb that contain capital letters and enter in the relevant values.  These will include your application name, your domain name, and the path to your repository.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow create a directory inside your config directory and name accelerator.  Then add the following three files into it:\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comaccelerator_tasks.rb' title='accelerator_tasks.rb'>accelerator_tasks.rb - contains Capistrano recipes specific to the Joyent Accelerator.</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comapache_vhost.erb' title='apache_vhost.erb'>apache_vhost.erb - configures apache to point to your rails application</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comsmf_template.erb' title='smf_template.erb'>smf_template.erb - starts up mongrel automatically for you when you system starts</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow we need a mongrel_cluster.yml file.  Create a file called mongrel_cluster.yml inside of your config directory and put this in it:\\nport: \\\"8000\\\"\\nenvironment: production\\naddress: 127.0.0.1\\npid_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/pids/mongrel.pid\\nlog_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/log/mongrel.log\\nservers: 3\\ndocroot: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current/public\\ncwd: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current\\n<p>You will need to edit the paths to match the paths you setup in deploy.rb.  This likely means that you will need to replace XXXXXXX with your joyent username and APP-NAME with the name of your application.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nSubversion needs to know how to talk to your repository if it is password protected.  ssh into the server and do this inside your home directory:\\nsvn co PATH TO YOUR PROJECT\\nYou can delete the directory when it is done.  You do this so that your svn username and password are cached on the server which means that Capistrano will be able to checkout files.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nWhile you are logged into the server be sure to create an empty database.  The name should match the name in your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nBe sure to enter the proper username for root into your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow for the exciting part:\\nRun <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">cap deploy:setup</pre></code> inside of the root of your Rails project.  It should run successfully.
