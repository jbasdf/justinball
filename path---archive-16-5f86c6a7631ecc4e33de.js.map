I have done this for two years now.</p>\\n<p>Anyone that knows me knows that I don't get up at 6:30. Sometimes I stay up and work until 6:30, but I don't get up at that time. That is unless God wants me to. Thus, on the 'day of rest' I drag my butt out of bed way to early in the morning so that I can go and do something else I never do - take notes by hand. I have used a computer for so many years now that I can type like mad, but I can barely use a pen. My signature is just a bunch of loopy lines and no one and I mean no one can read what I write. However, I take notes because that is my religious duty.</p>\\n<p>Truthfully, I don't mind it so much. I get to associate with people who are far more righteous than me. I keep thinking some of that spirituality will wear off on my, but it doesn't really so I have decided on a new course of action.</p>\\n<p>The latest trend is outsourcing. It started with programming. Get guys in India or various other countries to do your work for pennies on the dollar and stop paying these expensive local boys. It will work just like it did in manufacturing. (I'm not bitter). I heard that you can outsource a personal assistant. Heck, if you are willing to travel heart surgery in a foreign land is like a luxury vacation - except for that one part where they cut you open, but then again maybe that makes your journey more like an Indian Jones movie. Hopefully, they use something more sterile than their bare hands.</p>\\n<p>I would really like to spend my Sunday mornings in bed. After all, I am a very lazy person. However, I really need the spiritual benefits. Call them credits in heaven.</p>\\n<p>In this United States land of box stores, outlets, big cars, and urban sprawl we get what we want. I am simply unwilling to accept that I can't have it all so starting today I will be outsourcing all my religion. Call my effort modern day <a href=\\\"http://apps.facebook.com/indulgences/\\\">indulgences</a> advanced. Instead of just buying away sin I will be having various kind hearted souls in foreign lands deal with my volunteer work, salvation and other spiritual matters. I even plan on offering this service to others so that they may reap eternal rewards while sleeping in, reading the paper or just enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park.</p>\\n<p>Package pricing is as follows:</p>\\n<p><strong>Pretty Good: $49.95/month</strong>\\nAll activities will be performed by a novice spiritual outsourcing agent. They are just in training but no less righteous. They might have a few sins to work out, but what do you expect when you purchase salvation on the cheap?</p>\\n<p>10 minutes of scripture reading a day.\\n5 minutes repenting of your choice of wrong deeds.\\n2 minute prayers twice a day.\\n1 Sermon per year (optional) in case you need to speak in church or just for impressing friends when it comes to your new level of spirituality.</p>\\n<p>Note: This package is not guaranteed to get you into heaven, but at least it will keep your parents off your back.</p>\\n<p><strong>Righteous: $69.95/month</strong>\\nAll spiritual matters will be handle by one of our intermediate advisers.

I love cycling (not the embarassing secret unless you count running around in skin tight shorts as embarassing). No, the big secret is that when I am all alone on the bike I can't help but feel the desire to chase down every other cyclist on the road.</p>\\n<p>I will probably never race. It looks like a lot of hard work. However, for some reason whenever there is another person on the road something screams out to me to overtake them. I have frequently felt ashamed by my selected targets - an old guy on a bike, a girl on a mountain bike, etc. These are not Tour de France types of targets. To my credit I usually pick a distance, I am a mile back and I have to overtake them before the next stop sign - that sort of thing. On occasion my target will be a fellow cyclist that looks like he is a worthy opponent. I love it when I can overtake those guys, but then I am forced to continue to ride hard so they can't pass me. I don't want to look like an idiot.</p>\\n<p>Of course I am an idiot because all of this is pretty stupid and foolish, but then again when you ride the same road every day you need something to do.</p>\\n<p>I have been watching the Tour de France off and on even though it is lame that they won't let Alberto Contador or Levi Leipheimer ride which means Le Tour is Le unfair sucky sporting event of the year. Anyway, I can't help but think of Lance Armstrong every time the tour rolls around. I love to see the old clips with him riding in truly spectacular fashion. To come back from cancer and then win the most difficult sporting event in the world seven times is an unmatched accomplishment. His sacrifice is an inspiration that has been heralded many times.</p>\\n<p>Last night when I was riding home I spotted another target. This guy was moving at a good pace so I could resist. I figured I could catch him without any problem. There was a hill coming up that slows down most people and I figured I could push it at 20 mph for a bit and blow him away.</p>\\n<p>When I got to the hill he was already gone. I could have given up, but ... no I couldn't give up. I rode hard and fast. It took a few miles but I managed to get pretty close. Then he dropped his water bottle and kept on going. He obviously didn't notice. I thought about stopping to pick it up, but then decided if I did I would never catch him to give it back. I sprinted like crazy and managed to come up beside him. I told him that he had dropped the bottle. He politely replied, \\\"thanks\\\" and immediately turned around to retrieve the water bottle. I noticed that he was disabled. In the past I have complained about my back giving me problems and how that hurts. However, I noticed this gentleman had difficultly holding his head so that he could ride and had other disabilities. I also noticed that his calves were something to be jealous of. He was fast and strong. That speed had come at a much greater price than most of us have to pay.

The guy was really hairy and looked like grizzly adams. I would think he should have a \\\"save the bears\\\" sign, but I guess they figured the bears with those big claws could take care of themselves. Next to the couple was a sign that said something like \\\"first amendment at work.\\\" Below that was something like the park service has nothing to do with these crazy nuts who haven't showered in weeks. I'm glad the constitution still works. I told dad that we need to setup a booth. Something like \\\"shoot the damn wolves\\\" or \\\"bison make great burgers.\\\"</p>\\n<p>We ate lunch at Roosevelt and then hiked to 'lost falls' which earns its name, but we found it. The hike required that we walk up a steep trail on loose gravel and yell at the kids to \\\"get back here or I will spank your butt.\\\" When you are young you don't think about plummeting to your death in the creek below. When you are old you just get mad that you are walking down a stupid trail instead of sitting in front of the gift shop eating ice cream.</p>\\n<p>The Lamar Valley was next. They say it is the savannah of Yellowstone, except as my brother pointed out you can't go ripping across the meadows in a Land Rover and then blow through the rivers while chasing down exotic critters. Instead, if you drive more than 45 mph they pull you over, ask for your license and registration and tease your kids (ask Austin about that one). At least they didn't give him a ticket.</p>\\n<p>My daughters fascination with animals continued. \\\"I want to see a bear.\\\" Then we saw one. \\\"I want to see a buffalo.\\\" Then we saw a bunch. Sadly they are starting to think that their every wish and desire will be fulfilled at will. We tried to explain that we can't just make the animals appear on cue, but they keep appearing so we loose. I still haven't been able to see a bear eat anyone. What a disappointment.</p>\\n<p>Speaking of crappy experiences, we ate, or rather suffered through a meal at the Roosevelt Lodge. Getting a table took and hour and a half. Getting food took another 30 mins. Eating the food was a mediocre experience. If you are going to eat in the park take your food with you. Most of the staff we dealt with had a lower IQ than the inbred park Buffalo. Xanterra needs to get it together there. For the record the guy behind the gift counter was nice. The guys smoking on the porch were ass holes. Apparently, Wyoming still has lame smoking laws that let you blow cancer dust in everyone's face.

I am pretty sure they are trying to help you recreate traveling the park by horse and carriage.</li>\\n<li>If you try to drive faster than 35 mph in the park you will most likely plow into a Buffalo and die or plummet 1000 feet and die.</li>\\n<li>There are bears in this park so if you plan on tent camping then you can think of yourself as a snack in an easy to open package.</li>\\n</ol>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-28-yellowstone-3/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/yellowstone-3\",\"date\":\"2008-06-28T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Yellowstone 3\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"Sequels are never as good as the original so keep in mind that this one won't be as good as the last one which wasn't that great.

It sounds like something out of Lord of the Rings. Actually it is part of the secret ploy to kill as many tourists as possible. This is another one of those roads that remind you of some sort of perilous video game were the bad guys send RVs from Mordor your way to push you off the edge into oblivion.</p>\\n<p>I guess the view was cool.</p>\\n<p>The Canyon area of Yellowstone is a great place to reduce family size if you feel like you have to many kids. Artists point is a beautiful final resting place for annoying little Johnny.\\n\\\"No you go right ahead and climb on those rocks. It's totally safe.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Callie had to yell at Jenna to get off the rocks because, well I guess we like her. She did tell her that if she kept doing it she would probably plummet to her death in which case we would have to \\\"throw some dirt, say a little prayer and visit with flowers each year.\\\"</p>\\n<p>That would be way annoying because who wants to visit EVERY year.</p>\\n<p>We were going to go back to Tower and from there make our way back to Gardiner, but like I said that road is designed to kill you so instead we drove over to Norris. On the way over we drove the Virginia Cascade loop which is a stupid loop because you drive it and expect to see something then you drive right past the thing you are supposed to see (the cascades) because it isn't marked and there is no where to stop. There is even a sign that says \\\"your tax dollars at work.\\\" I better be getting those dollars back my next tax refund.</p>\\n<p>We dropped by Norris geyser basin where sometimes the dirt gets so hot (200) that you could cook an egg - that's the scientific measure for damn hot. The entire area is filled with boiling water and stinky sulfur like smells. Its like a sauna in a men's room. There is a geyser there (steamboat) that erupts at sporadic intervals where sporadic might be once in 50 years. We had to get back to the cabin to cook pizza so we didn't wait. Other than that the ground was filled with little areas of boiling water. For some reason I thought that was one of the most impressive parts of the park - dirt that can boil water. Sometimes I wonder what the hell is wrong with me.</p>\\n<p>Jenna is still on her wildlife hunt. On the way back there were critters behind every tree so we tuned her out - that is a crucial life skill. They should teach tuning out kids in high school. I guess they do only it is tuning out parents at that point in your life.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, Jenna says, \\\"I see a bear.\\\" She actually says it \\\"bewa,\\\" but we are expert translators. We tune that out until Jimmy (bro in law) gets on the radio (aren't we dorks) and says, \\\"there is a bear back there.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Like any good tourist we whipped around, blocked traffic and took as many pictures as we could. We noticed some really bad tourists way out in the brush CHASING THE BEAR. I really wish we could have gotten a picture of a bear eating a moron, but alas the bear must have been full.</p>\\n<p>We stopped at the Golden Gate - so named because of lichen - take that San Francisco. This is a creepy road because they couldn't cut into the mountain so they built the road on pillars out over the canyon. We stopped because we like to take pictures of interesting places to die. They have replaced this thing three times. That tells you it is a bad place to be when one of the big ones hit. It was actually a good think we stopped because it slowed down our journey and ensured that we didn't slam into the buffalo that decided the bridge would be much easier than a climb over the mountain. For a long time he stood in front of the lot of us like that guy in front of the tanks at Tieneman Square. After a while the critter felt like his political point had been made, but just to be sure he walked alongside the long stream of cars that had been backed up by his protest. I could have reached out the window and pet the thing. That would be yucky.</p>\\n<p>You would think that our wildlife quota had been met, but right above Mammoth the grouping of cars said otherwise. Right off the road was a young grizzly bear. He didn't look like he was going to eat any of the stupid tourists who were wandering around so we moved on. You can see non-tourist eating bears in the zoo anytime.</p>\\n<p>We got back.

Like the Earth's anus this place belches the nastiest gas you have ever smelled. The girls love it, but hold their noses a lot. I am good with it except for the terrifying narrow roads with the sheer drops seeking to plummet you to your death. There are a lot of animals too. Big ones. I guess that is to be expected. When I was in high school I used to bring dates up here. I got stuck in a herd of 300 buffalo and nearly missed our show at Pierre's Playhouse. I wonder if that place is still around. My dad doesn't know, but that was the same day that I had a park ranger pull up while I and said date were picnicking and tell me there they had had reports of a red car a lot like mine flying past obnoxious RVs at 100mph which was very illegal in the park.</p>\\n<p>I had (and still have) no idea what he was talking about. Luckily my brother destroyed any evidence a few years later by slamming it into a concrete wall.</p>\\n<p>Park rangers tend to be annoying people that can't get actual jobs. They tend to think everyone else has absolutely no right to visit their park and for all they care the general populous can just die (which is why they design the roads here they way they do and then put up abstract road signs like \\\"danger ahead\\\", \\\"just drive off the road and die\\\" or \\\"debris on road\\\" which means there is a boulder up here perched such that if anyone sneezes it will crush you and your atomic family. I made one of those up. My favorite sign is \\\"Rough Break Ahead\\\". It's kind of like a fortune cookie from a bad Chinese restaurant. It also describes my life.</p>\\n<p>I met one of these park rangers this morning. I bet he was from the east coast, works at an investment firm and thinks he can spend the summer in Yellowstone and save the wolves or something. My daughters love maps. I requested 4. One for us so that we can navigate the park and three for the girls. He gives me this \\\"why do you need four maps.\\\" I wanted to say, \\\"we ran out of toilet paper and I need to wipe my ass,\\\" but instead I politely explained that my girls love maps and they learn from them, bla bla. He says, \\\"I'll give you three.\\\" I wanted to say, \\\"I think you failed math,\\\" but instead I thanked him. Then he gave me a park newsletter and explained that I should review the park rules and regulations with my family and that they can be found on page 2. I grew up a bit more than an hour from the park. This is my backyard. I would have loved to describe to him interesting uses of page 2, but instead I smiled and drove on to the Walmart of Yellowstone, Old Faithful.</p>\\n<p>Everyone goes there. We must go there too.</p>\\n<p>Its hard to describe the area anymore. There are more lodges here than hotels on the strip in Las Vegas. The parking lot reminds me of Walmart at Christmas. The company that runs the lodges and restaurants in the park imports employees from around the world. That makes your national park experience 'multi-cultural.' In fact it means 'cheap labor'.

Tomorrow it will be used at ICLS in the Netherlands. The hardest part about these kinds of applications is life cycle management. I am frequently asked to build a 'quick and dirty' application. Years of experience has taught me that there is no such thing. Anytime you are asked to build an application you are being asked to commit to keep it alive. What inevitably happens is that someone sees it and assumes that it only needs a few tweaks to adapt it to a new use. If your code is to dirty then forget it. Adaptation almost always runs you into new errors that you have to deal with in new ways.</p>\\n<p>Whenever creating an application it is always worth the time to get tests in place. It is always worth the time to think about the architecture - not the architecture for the entire system - but rather the big picture. How will the application be deployed? What services will it depend on? What happens when the code becomes obsolete and needs to updated? This is a very real issue with Rails. Methods are deprecated or changed and plugins stop working. I know that most people like to believe that once an application is done it is done. This is a terrible fallacy. Every application requires attention to manage bugs, growth, obsolescence.</p>\\n<p>Every time I am asked to bring up an old application I am reminded of these issues. Best of luck and enjoy the application to all 51weeks users at ICLS.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-24-51weeks-at-icls/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/51weeks-at-icls\",\"date\":\"2008-06-24T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"51Weeks at ICLS\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"One of my favorite rides is Blacksmith Fork Canyon.

It was a bigger deal then and one of the major networks carried it. Now you have to have cable. You can watch golf anytime, but cycling's biggest event isn't worth the effort. Golf isn't even a real sport. Anyway, I was always amazed when the peleton would grab a bite to eat while riding at 20 mph. I tried it a few times and nearly choked. In more recent years as I have started riding more I have found that in order to ride 100 miles you have to learn to eat on the bike. The first time I tried it I choked again. Stupid sport.</p>\\n<p>In spite of my initial problems I have figured it out and now I usually gnaw on a Cliff bar and down a bottle of Accelerade on the way up so that I am good for the ride down (which always seems to be against the wind).

That is unless God wants me to. Thus, on the 'day of rest' I drag my butt out of bed way to early in the morning so that I can go and do something else I never do - take notes by hand. I have used a computer for so many years now that I can type like mad, but I can barely use a pen. My signature is just a bunch of loopy lines and no one and I mean no one can read what I write. However, I take notes because that is my religious duty.</p>\\n<p>Truthfully, I don't mind it so much. I get to associate with people who are far more righteous than me. I keep thinking some of that spirituality will wear off on my, but it doesn't really so I have decided on a new course of action.</p>\\n<p>The latest trend is outsourcing. It started with programming. Get guys in India or various other countries to do your work for pennies on the dollar and stop paying these expensive local boys. It will work just like it did in manufacturing. (I'm not bitter). I heard that you can outsource a personal assistant. Heck, if you are willing to travel heart surgery in a foreign land is like a luxury vacation - except for that one part where they cut you open, but then again maybe that makes your journey more like an Indian Jones movie. Hopefully, they use something more sterile than their bare hands.</p>\\n<p>I would really like to spend my Sunday mornings in bed. After all, I am a very lazy person. However, I really need the spiritual benefits. Call them credits in heaven.</p>\\n<p>In this United States land of box stores, outlets, big cars, and urban sprawl we get what we want. I am simply unwilling to accept that I can't have it all so starting today I will be outsourcing all my religion. Call my effort modern day <a href=\\\"http://apps.facebook.com/indulgences/\\\">indulgences</a> advanced. Instead of just buying away sin I will be having various kind hearted souls in foreign lands deal with my volunteer work, salvation and other spiritual matters. I even plan on offering this service to others so that they may reap eternal rewards while sleeping in, reading the paper or just enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park.</p>\\n<p>Package pricing is as follows:</p>\\n<p><strong>Pretty Good: $49.95/month</strong>\\nAll activities will be performed by a novice spiritual outsourcing agent. They are just in training but no less righteous. They might have a few sins to work out, but what do you expect when you purchase salvation on the cheap?</p>\\n<p>10 minutes of scripture reading a day.\\n5 minutes repenting of your choice of wrong deeds.\\n2 minute prayers twice a day.\\n1 Sermon per year (optional) in case you need to speak in church or just for impressing friends when it comes to your new level of spirituality.</p>\\n<p>Note: This package is not guaranteed to get you into heaven, but at least it will keep your parents off your back.</p>\\n<p><strong>Righteous: $69.95/month</strong>\\nAll spiritual matters will be handle by one of our intermediate advisers.

I love cycling (not the embarassing secret unless you count running around in skin tight shorts as embarassing). No, the big secret is that when I am all alone on the bike I can't help but feel the desire to chase down every other cyclist on the road.</p>\\n<p>I will probably never race. It looks like a lot of hard work. However, for some reason whenever there is another person on the road something screams out to me to overtake them. I have frequently felt ashamed by my selected targets - an old guy on a bike, a girl on a mountain bike, etc. These are not Tour de France types of targets. To my credit I usually pick a distance, I am a mile back and I have to overtake them before the next stop sign - that sort of thing. On occasion my target will be a fellow cyclist that looks like he is a worthy opponent. I love it when I can overtake those guys, but then I am forced to continue to ride hard so they can't pass me. I don't want to look like an idiot.</p>\\n<p>Of course I am an idiot because all of this is pretty stupid and foolish, but then again when you ride the same road every day you need something to do.</p>\\n<p>I have been watching the Tour de France off and on even though it is lame that they won't let Alberto Contador or Levi Leipheimer ride which means Le Tour is Le unfair sucky sporting event of the year. Anyway, I can't help but think of Lance Armstrong every time the tour rolls around. I love to see the old clips with him riding in truly spectacular fashion. To come back from cancer and then win the most difficult sporting event in the world seven times is an unmatched accomplishment. His sacrifice is an inspiration that has been heralded many times.</p>\\n<p>Last night when I was riding home I spotted another target. This guy was moving at a good pace so I could resist. I figured I could catch him without any problem. There was a hill coming up that slows down most people and I figured I could push it at 20 mph for a bit and blow him away.</p>\\n<p>When I got to the hill he was already gone. I could have given up, but ... no I couldn't give up. I rode hard and fast. It took a few miles but I managed to get pretty close. Then he dropped his water bottle and kept on going. He obviously didn't notice. I thought about stopping to pick it up, but then decided if I did I would never catch him to give it back. I sprinted like crazy and managed to come up beside him. I told him that he had dropped the bottle. He politely replied, \\\"thanks\\\" and immediately turned around to retrieve the water bottle. I noticed that he was disabled. In the past I have complained about my back giving me problems and how that hurts. However, I noticed this gentleman had difficultly holding his head so that he could ride and had other disabilities. I also noticed that his calves were something to be jealous of. He was fast and strong. That speed had come at a much greater price than most of us have to pay. It probably wasn't easy to navigate his bike, but he did so with grace and speed.</p>\\n<p>There are many well known inspirations - Lance Armstrong, Alberto Contador. They are very abstract to most of us. Among the rest of us live others who are no less an inspiration in their own right.</p>\\n<p>Last night I was inspired not by a cycling great, but by a guy who, in spite of difficulty, was great at cycling.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-07-22-secrets-and-inspirations/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/secrets-and-inspirations\",\"date\":\"2008-07-22T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Secrets and Inspirations\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I was pretty excited to see the new app store show up on iTunes.

The guys smoking on the porch were ass holes. Apparently, Wyoming still has lame smoking laws that let you blow cancer dust in everyone's face. I would have really like to see one of those guys get eaten by a bear:</p>\\n<p>Bear 1: \\\"Hey Bob, look. Smoked jerk tonight.\\\"\\nBear 2: \\\"No way those guys will give you cancer.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Believe it or not this concludes most of our family trip.</p>\\n<p>The End</p>\\n<p>OK, not. A couple of interesting facts about the park:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The only place you can make a cell phone call on your iPhone is at Old Faithful. They take this whole primitive thing way to far.</li>\\n<li>Edge doesn't work anywhere so you can't check your email in Yellowstone. This will force you to focus more on your family whether you like it or not.</li>\\n<li>18 miles in Yellowstone is like driving to California. 35mph is way slow. I am pretty sure they are trying to help you recreate traveling the park by horse and carriage.</li>\\n<li>If you try to drive faster than 35 mph in the park you will most likely plow into a Buffalo and die or plummet 1000 feet and die.</li>\\n<li>There are bears in this park so if you plan on tent camping then you can think of yourself as a snack in an easy to open package.</li>\\n</ol>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-28-yellowstone-3/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/yellowstone-3\",\"date\":\"2008-06-28T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Yellowstone 3\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"Sequels are never as good as the original so keep in mind that this one won't be as good as the last one which wasn't that great.

It sounds like something out of Lord of the Rings. Actually it is part of the secret ploy to kill as many tourists as possible. This is another one of those roads that remind you of some sort of perilous video game were the bad guys send RVs from Mordor your way to push you off the edge into oblivion.</p>\\n<p>I guess the view was cool.</p>\\n<p>The Canyon area of Yellowstone is a great place to reduce family size if you feel like you have to many kids. Artists point is a beautiful final resting place for annoying little Johnny.\\n\\\"No you go right ahead and climb on those rocks. It's totally safe.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Callie had to yell at Jenna to get off the rocks because, well I guess we like her. She did tell her that if she kept doing it she would probably plummet to her death in which case we would have to \\\"throw some dirt, say a little prayer and visit with flowers each year.\\\"</p>\\n<p>That would be way annoying because who wants to visit EVERY year.</p>\\n<p>We were going to go back to Tower and from there make our way back to Gardiner, but like I said that road is designed to kill you so instead we drove over to Norris. On the way over we drove the Virginia Cascade loop which is a stupid loop because you drive it and expect to see something then you drive right past the thing you are supposed to see (the cascades) because it isn't marked and there is no where to stop. There is even a sign that says \\\"your tax dollars at work.\\\" I better be getting those dollars back my next tax refund.</p>\\n<p>We dropped by Norris geyser basin where sometimes the dirt gets so hot (200) that you could cook an egg - that's the scientific measure for damn hot. The entire area is filled with boiling water and stinky sulfur like smells. Its like a sauna in a men's room. There is a geyser there (steamboat) that erupts at sporadic intervals where sporadic might be once in 50 years. We had to get back to the cabin to cook pizza so we didn't wait. Other than that the ground was filled with little areas of boiling water. For some reason I thought that was one of the most impressive parts of the park - dirt that can boil water. Sometimes I wonder what the hell is wrong with me.</p>\\n<p>Jenna is still on her wildlife hunt. On the way back there were critters behind every tree so we tuned her out - that is a crucial life skill. They should teach tuning out kids in high school. I guess they do only it is tuning out parents at that point in your life.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, Jenna says, \\\"I see a bear.\\\" She actually says it \\\"bewa,\\\" but we are expert translators. We tune that out until Jimmy (bro in law) gets on the radio (aren't we dorks) and says, \\\"there is a bear back there.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Like any good tourist we whipped around, blocked traffic and took as many pictures as we could. We noticed some really bad tourists way out in the brush CHASING THE BEAR. I really wish we could have gotten a picture of a bear eating a moron, but alas the bear must have been full.</p>\\n<p>We stopped at the Golden Gate - so named because of lichen - take that San Francisco. This is a creepy road because they couldn't cut into the mountain so they built the road on pillars out over the canyon. We stopped because we like to take pictures of interesting places to die. They have replaced this thing three times. That tells you it is a bad place to be when one of the big ones hit. It was actually a good think we stopped because it slowed down our journey and ensured that we didn't slam into the buffalo that decided the bridge would be much easier than a climb over the mountain. For a long time he stood in front of the lot of us like that guy in front of the tanks at Tieneman Square. After a while the critter felt like his political point had been made, but just to be sure he walked alongside the long stream of cars that had been backed up by his protest. I could have reached out the window and pet the thing. That would be yucky.</p>\\n<p>You would think that our wildlife quota had been met, but right above Mammoth the grouping of cars said otherwise. Right off the road was a young grizzly bear. He didn't look like he was going to eat any of the stupid tourists who were wandering around so we moved on. You can see non-tourist eating bears in the zoo anytime.</p>\\n<p>We got back. Ate our pizza and now it is 1 am again.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-28-yellowstone-2/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/yellowstone-2\",\"date\":\"2008-06-28T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Yellowstone 2\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"We went to the happiest place on earth, now we're off on a family vacation to the stinkiest place on Earth - Yellowstone.

Like the Earth's anus this place belches the nastiest gas you have ever smelled. The girls love it, but hold their noses a lot. I am good with it except for the terrifying narrow roads with the sheer drops seeking to plummet you to your death. There are a lot of animals too. Big ones. I guess that is to be expected. When I was in high school I used to bring dates up here. I got stuck in a herd of 300 buffalo and nearly missed our show at Pierre's Playhouse. I wonder if that place is still around. My dad doesn't know, but that was the same day that I had a park ranger pull up while I and said date were picnicking and tell me there they had had reports of a red car a lot like mine flying past obnoxious RVs at 100mph which was very illegal in the park.</p>\\n<p>I had (and still have) no idea what he was talking about. Luckily my brother destroyed any evidence a few years later by slamming it into a concrete wall.</p>\\n<p>Park rangers tend to be annoying people that can't get actual jobs. They tend to think everyone else has absolutely no right to visit their park and for all they care the general populous can just die (which is why they design the roads here they way they do and then put up abstract road signs like \\\"danger ahead\\\", \\\"just drive off the road and die\\\" or \\\"debris on road\\\" which means there is a boulder up here perched such that if anyone sneezes it will crush you and your atomic family. I made one of those up. My favorite sign is \\\"Rough Break Ahead\\\". It's kind of like a fortune cookie from a bad Chinese restaurant. It also describes my life.</p>\\n<p>I met one of these park rangers this morning. I bet he was from the east coast, works at an investment firm and thinks he can spend the summer in Yellowstone and save the wolves or something. My daughters love maps. I requested 4. One for us so that we can navigate the park and three for the girls. He gives me this \\\"why do you need four maps.\\\" I wanted to say, \\\"we ran out of toilet paper and I need to wipe my ass,\\\" but instead I politely explained that my girls love maps and they learn from them, bla bla. He says, \\\"I'll give you three.\\\" I wanted to say, \\\"I think you failed math,\\\" but instead I thanked him. Then he gave me a park newsletter and explained that I should review the park rules and regulations with my family and that they can be found on page 2. I grew up a bit more than an hour from the park. This is my backyard. I would have loved to describe to him interesting uses of page 2, but instead I smiled and drove on to the Walmart of Yellowstone, Old Faithful.</p>\\n<p>Everyone goes there. We must go there too.</p>\\n<p>Its hard to describe the area anymore. There are more lodges here than hotels on the strip in Las Vegas. The parking lot reminds me of Walmart at Christmas. The company that runs the lodges and restaurants in the park imports employees from around the world. That makes your national park experience 'multi-cultural.' In fact it means 'cheap labor'. The poor guy helping me out had a heck of a time getting hot dogs and macaroni and cheese for my kids. We can barely understand the kids sometimes. Some guy from rural China has no chance.</p>\\n<p>I think the kids had fun today. Jenna is fascinated by the animals and constantly asks about where they live and can she see them. When she doesn't see actual animals she looks for signs of animals which are plentiful around the various park features:\\n\\\"What poop is that?\\\"\\n\\\"That's elk poop Jenna\\\"\\n\\\"What about that poop?\\\"\\n\\\"That's buffalo poop Jenna.\\\"\\n\\\"What about that poop.\\\"\\n\\\"That's elk poop Jenna.\\\"\\n\\\"What about that?\\\"\\n\\\"That's where daddy used page 2 ...\\\"</p>\\n\\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-fc46b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAwX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAcZhjlpJL//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhESIjL/2gAIAQEAAQUCKZBapmTIc//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABYQAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMf/aAAgBAQAGPwIi/wD/xAAbEAACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARExIVFxof/aAAgBAQABPyET6lwZZZGI0OOD+j//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEGMf/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEx/9oACAEDAQE/EEx//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBH/2gAIAQIBAT8Qp//EABsQAQADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQVFh/9oACAEBAAE/ED4W3MVl4FlRrZu5eV3HlVe4iulW2rP/2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"Bear in Yellowstone\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-b80fa.jpg\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-cf410.jpg 163w,\\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-62f2a.jpg 325w,\\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-b80fa.jpg 650w,\\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-08cb4.jpg 975w,\\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-fd4ba.jpg 1950w,\\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-fc46b.jpg 3888w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    \",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-27-yellowstone/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/yellowstone\",\"date\":\"2008-06-27T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Yellowstone\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"sizes\":{\"src\":\"/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-381d6.jpg\"}}}}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"Last year for  our open ed conference here at Utah State  I built an application called  51weeks  to help preserve the presentations and to help people interact.

Tomorrow it will be used at ICLS in the Netherlands. The hardest part about these kinds of applications is life cycle management. I am frequently asked to build a 'quick and dirty' application. Years of experience has taught me that there is no such thing. Anytime you are asked to build an application you are being asked to commit to keep it alive. What inevitably happens is that someone sees it and assumes that it only needs a few tweaks to adapt it to a new use. If your code is to dirty then forget it. Adaptation almost always runs you into new errors that you have to deal with in new ways.</p>\\n<p>Whenever creating an application it is always worth the time to get tests in place. It is always worth the time to think about the architecture - not the architecture for the entire system - but rather the big picture. How will the application be deployed? What services will it depend on? What happens when the code becomes obsolete and needs to updated? This is a very real issue with Rails. Methods are deprecated or changed and plugins stop working. I know that most people like to believe that once an application is done it is done. This is a terrible fallacy. Every application requires attention to manage bugs, growth, obsolescence.</p>\\n<p>Every time I am asked to bring up an old application I am reminded of these issues.

It was a bigger deal then and one of the major networks carried it. Now you have to have cable. You can watch golf anytime, but cycling's biggest event isn't worth the effort. Golf isn't even a real sport. Anyway, I was always amazed when the peleton would grab a bite to eat while riding at 20 mph. I tried it a few times and nearly choked. In more recent years as I have started riding more I have found that in order to ride 100 miles you have to learn to eat on the bike. The first time I tried it I choked again. Stupid sport.</p>\\n<p>In spite of my initial problems I have figured it out and now I usually gnaw on a Cliff bar and down a bottle of Accelerade on the way up so that I am good for the ride down (which always seems to be against the wind).
