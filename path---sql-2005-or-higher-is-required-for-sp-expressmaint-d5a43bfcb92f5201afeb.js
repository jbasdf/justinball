I went to the command line to run the task and got \'SQL2005 or higher is required for sp_expressmaint\'. Turns out there is a bug in the sp_expressmaint stored procedure that ships with SQL Server 2008 Express Edition. <a href="http://developers.de/blogs/senad_hajric/archive/2009/05/25/bug-sql-2008-express-edition-stored-procedure-sp-dbmaintenance.aspx">The first result on Google provided the solution</a>. Luckily it\'s really easy to fix. Just open up the stored procedures on your master database (they\'re under \'programability\'). Then find this line:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">IF (select SUBSTRING(@@version,(CHARINDEX(&#39;-&#39;,@@version) 2),1))</code></pre>\n      </div>',frontmatter:{title:"SQL2005 or higher is required for sp_expressmaint",date:"November 22, 2010",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
