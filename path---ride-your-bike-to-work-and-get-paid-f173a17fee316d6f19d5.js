I live in Cache County. On days after it rains, for a few hours I am reminded of how beautiful the valley is when it is not engrossed in haze. I am not a hardcore environmentalist, but I try to do what I can. My efforts include riding my bike to work. We give tax breaks to those who can find an excuse to purchase a large SUV as a "business" expense. We keep gas prices low to keep citizens happy. (Gas prices in other countries are double and triple what they are in the United States). Cheap energy has been our privilege. I enjoy the benefits of that privilege, but isn\'t it time to put efforts into alternative transportation that is not only environmentally friendly, but also healthy.</p>\n</blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"Ride Your Bike to Work and Get PAID!!!",date:"June 12, 2007",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/ride-your-bike-to-work-and-get-paid"}}}});
