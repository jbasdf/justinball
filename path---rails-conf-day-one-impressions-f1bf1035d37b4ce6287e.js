Don’t worry I probably won’t.</p>\n<p>My overall impression of the pre conference tutorials was that they were aimed at beginning users. If you have background in any of the topics then you might get a little value but 4 hours is a high price to pay for a little value.</p>\n<p>I was originally critical of the first part of Jason Hoffman’s talk but last night I met some guys that really liked it. I guess it depends on what information you need. As a side note of all the talks yesterday Jason’s is a favorite. You can <a href="http://joyeur.com/2007/05/18/slides-for-my-railsconf-talk-scaling-a-rails-application-from-the-bottom-up">download the slides from his blog</a>. If you have to scale any kind of web application, not just Rails, download and look through his slides. There is information in there that would cost you a small fortune to research.</p>\n<p>We had time to chat with other developers from Utah last night. There are a decent number of guys in Utah working in either Ruby or Rails or both. We spent a few minutes talking about user groups and how they are and aren’t successful. We talked a bit about the Mountain West conference – mainly Chad Fowler’s talk. I’ll post about that in a minute. It was interesting to note that Carl Youngblood has moved to Surgeworks. He is the guy that gave Bayesian networks talk at the Mountain West Ruby conference.</p>\n<p>As a side note Portland offers some nice restaurants. We had some really good seafood last night. <a href="http://www.rivercitybicycles.com/">River City Bikes</a> is a pretty sweet bike shop and gave me the opportunity to try out a <a href="http://www.calfeedesign.com/">Calfee</a> which is just an awesome bike.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Rails Conf Day One Impressions",date:"May 18, 2007",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/rails-conf-day-one-impressions"}}}});
