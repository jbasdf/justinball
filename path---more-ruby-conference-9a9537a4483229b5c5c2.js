I slept till 9:30, but mainly because we were up till 4am. <a href="http://appeddesign.com/apropos">Dave South</a> gave me some great info on using TestSpec. RSpec seems to be the hot thing right now, but I like how TestSpec is lightweight:</p>\n<p>Install the gem:\nsudo gem install test-spec</p>\n<p>Install the plugin:\n./script/plugins install <a href="http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/test%5C_spec%5C_on_rails/">http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/test_spec_on_rails/</a></p>\n<p>Require in test_helper:\nrequire \'test/spec/rails\'</p>\n<p>I spent a good part of last night rewriting some tests to use TestSpec.
