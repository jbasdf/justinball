They had a great time. At the end of the day we wandered around the area a bit and since there is an Apple store I dropped in to see if they could solve my problem.</p>\n<p>I told my wife it would only be a few minutes. Several hours later a finally got to talk to some high school kid that knew how to turn on the Mac and crop a photo in Photoshop but other than that they were pretty worthless. At least the store looks cool.</p>\n<p>My journey to the Apple store started when I switched my monitory input. I have a 24" Dell monitor and I plug my Macbook Pro into that. As long as I used my DVI to VGA adapter the Macbook Pro would automatically detect when the monitor was plugged in. I figured that since I used my Mac almost exclusively these days I would use the DVI input for the better picture. However, when I started plugging directly into the DVI cable the Macbook Pro no longer recognized when the monitor was plugged in or not plugged in. This is a minor annoyance, but it bugged me so I determined to find a solution which is how I ended up at the Apple store.</p>\n<p>They were no help at all and wasted a lot of my time and my poor wife had to wander around the gateway with the kids while I waited (Of course they couldn\'t let me leave the store and just call my cell. I had to sit there). Did I mentioned that my trip to the Apple store was a total waste?</p>\n<p>I had guessed for a while that it might have something to do with the cable. I being cheap didn\'t want to buy a new one (I know I should have borrowed one) to test. I just assumed that the Apple geeks would know whether or not a cable would matter. They didn\'t.</p>\n<p>It turns out the cable is the issue. So if you find that your Mac doesn\'t automatically recognize the monitor check the cable. It won\'t work with a single link DVI cable, but will work with a dual link DVI cable.</p>\n<p>Here\'s a single link DVI cable. You don\'t want this one:\n<img src="img_4038.jpg" alt="Single Link DVI cable" title="Single Link DVI cable"></p>\n<p>Here\'s a Dual link DVI cable. You do want this one:\n<img src="img_4036.jpg" alt="Dual Link DVI Cable" title="Dual Link DVI Cable"></p>\n<p>The only visible difference is the pin count. The Single link DVI doesn\'t have the pins in the middle.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000X0VCY?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=jusbal-20&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B0000X0VCY">I bought this one from Amazon and it worked great. </a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jusbal-20&#x26;l=as2&#x26;o=1&#x26;a=B0000X0VCY"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"My Macbook Pro, the Single Link DVI cable and the Not so Genius Apple Bar",date:"March 01, 2009",imageUrl:null,image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/img_4038-5aa8467d998374c470d6f0f28a1d7c5f-381d6.jpg"}}}}}},pathContext:{path:"/my-macbook-pro-the-single-link-dvi-cable-and-the-not-so-genius-apple-bar"}}}});
