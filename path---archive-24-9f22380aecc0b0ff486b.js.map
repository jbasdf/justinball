Free hosting with one of the premier Ruby on Rails hosts.  I normally have to eat bags of M&#x26;Ms to be this happy.</p>\\n<p>Not all is roses.  There is a dark side to this free hosting.  Setting it up will make you want to cry.  I am a developer, not a Solaris system administrator and so getting my application deployed was like having a vasectomy and being totally conscious the entire time.  In hopes of saving time in the future for myself and others here is how to configure your Facebook Rails application for deployment via Capistrano on a Joyent Accelerator.  The ideas aren't mine.  I stole everything from all over the place.  I added links at the bottom where I found some of the information.  The rest of it I will just feel guilty about.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li> <a href=\\\"http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=12629\\\">Setup your shell for capistrano</a>.  Follow the link for the how and why.\\n   Note my $HOME/.ssh/environment file contains this:\\n    <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/ucb:\\n/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/sbin:\\n/opt/csw/gnu:/opt/csw/gcc3/bin:/opt/csw/mysql5/bin:\\n/opt/csw/postgresql/bin:/opt/csw/apache2/bin:\\n/opt/csw/apache2/sbin\\n</pre></code>\\n  Also be careful so that you don't edit ssh_config instead of sshd_config not that anyone would ever be so stupid and do that.  :-)\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  Make sure you have the Capistrano gem installed on your local machine:\\n  <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">sudo gem install capistrano</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  capify your application:\\n   In the root of your rails application run this:\\n   <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">capify .</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  You will now have a deploy.rb in your config directory.  Replace it with this <a href='http://www.justinball.comdeploy.rb' title='deploy.rb'>deploy.rb</a>.\\nThen be sure to replace the XXXXXXXX with the username provided to you in your welcome email from Joyent.  Then look for the sections of deploy.rb that contain capital letters and enter in the relevant values.  These will include your application name, your domain name, and the path to your repository.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow create a directory inside your config directory and name accelerator.  Then add the following three files into it:\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comaccelerator_tasks.rb' title='accelerator_tasks.rb'>accelerator_tasks.rb - contains Capistrano recipes specific to the Joyent Accelerator.</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comapache_vhost.erb' title='apache_vhost.erb'>apache_vhost.erb - configures apache to point to your rails application</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comsmf_template.erb' title='smf_template.erb'>smf_template.erb - starts up mongrel automatically for you when you system starts</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow we need a mongrel_cluster.yml file.  Create a file called mongrel_cluster.yml inside of your config directory and put this in it:\\nport: \\\"8000\\\"\\nenvironment: production\\naddress: 127.0.0.1\\npid_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/pids/mongrel.pid\\nlog_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/log/mongrel.log\\nservers: 3\\ndocroot: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current/public\\ncwd: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current\\n<p>You will need to edit the paths to match the paths you setup in deploy.rb.  This likely means that you will need to replace XXXXXXX with your joyent username and APP-NAME with the name of your application.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nSubversion needs to know how to talk to your repository if it is password protected.  ssh into the server and do this inside your home directory:\\nsvn co PATH TO YOUR PROJECT\\nYou can delete the directory when it is done.  You do this so that your svn username and password are cached on the server which means that Capistrano will be able to checkout files.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nWhile you are logged into the server be sure to create an empty database.  The name should match the name in your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nBe sure to enter the proper username for root into your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow for the exciting part:\\nRun <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">cap deploy:setup</pre></code> inside of the root of your Rails project.  It should run successfully.  If not I am very sorry.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nThen do this:\\ncap deploy:cold\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\nYou should be up and running at that point.\\n<p>More helps and information:\\n<a href=\\\"http://wiki.joyent.com/facebook:kb:faststart\\\">Joyent's quickstart</a>.

The lock simply means that an alert will show up anytime someone tries to check your account which will tell the person checking to contact you directly.</li>\\n<li>Pull a credit report from at least one of the agencies once a year or so. <a href=\\\"https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp\\\">By law you can do this for free once a year on this website</a>. <a href=\\\"http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/freereports.shtm\\\">If you want to make sure that site is legit you can look at the FTC website here.</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Numbers to keep handy</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Equifax: 800-525-6285</li>\\n<li>Experian (formerly TRW): 888-397-3742</li>\\n<li>TransUnion : 800-680-7289</li>\\n<li>Social Security Administration (fraud line): 800-269-0271</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Here are some other general tips for keeping your money safe:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>I have terrible hand writing and with the electronic signature pads now used my signature NEVER matches the signature on the back of my card. In the future write \\\"PHOTO ID REQUIRED.\\\" on the back of the card (not that the clerks ever look at my card anyway so it is unlikely they would ever see that, but it is a step.</li>\\n<li>If you write a check to pay your credit card don't write the credit card number on the check. If you must just put on the last four numbers.</li>\\n<li>Use a cell phone or work number on your checks. Use a PO Box for your address if you can. Never put your social security number on anything. Better yet use a credit card instead of a check to pay. The credit card gives you some level of protection.</li>\\n<li>Photocopy everything in your wallet and store the copies in a secure location</li>\\n<li>Copy any and all phone numbers off of the items in your wallet. Keep the numbers in your car or if you are traveling in your luggage. It is unlikely that anyone will want to still the phone numbers (they couldn't do anything with them anyway) but if your wallet is stolen you can make a couple of quick phone calls to lock down your cards.</li>\\n<li>If you have a passport make a photocopy and keep that with you when you travel just in case your actual passport is stolen.</li>\\n<li>Check your credit card and bank accounts often to watch for suspicious activity.</li>\\n<li>If your wallet or card is stolen contact the police immediately and file a report where your wallet was stolen.</li>\\n</ol>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-11-10-tips-to-prevent-identity-theft/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/tips-to-prevent-identity-theft\",\"date\":\"2007-11-10T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Tips to Prevent Identity Theft\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Interesting\",\"identity_theft\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I love NPR.

I was listening to it last night on the way home and Will Bowen of <a href=\\\"http://ccunitykc.org/\\\">Christ Church Unity</a> was on talking about his <a href=\\\"http://allday.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/03/29/101595.aspx\\\">no complaint</a> for <a href=\\\"http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17362505/\\\">21 days program</a> and the purple bracelets he passes out to help people to remember not to complain. This morning on my way in they were talking to <a href=\\\"http://www.davidco.com/\\\">David Allen</a>, the author of \\\"Getting Things Done\\\". More than productivity David Allen the gist of Allen's interview for me was perspective.</p>\\n<p>Allen talked about how important it is to maintain perspective in life. At times we are forced to work with people we don't want to work with. Our relationships may not go the way we want them to go. Many of the parameters for our life are set for us so it is up to us to decide what to do with what we have. He made the point that many human beings in the most dire of circumstances still maintain a hopefully, happy perspective - it is the thing we have control over and the thing we can change. As we improve our perspective guess what, our lives improve. Call it Kharma or call it positive energy whatever. Positive people tend to have positive lives. (I don't count myself as a positive person generally).</p>\\n<p>A concrete example of someone in dire circumstances who has inspired people the world over is <a href=\\\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/\\\">Randy Pausch</a>. He is a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon. They have a\\nlast lecture' series. The point of which is for faculty to give a lecture as if it is their last. Unfortunately, Randy's last lecture really is his last. He is retiring because he has pancreatic cancer.\\nHe recently gave his <a href=\\\"http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/\\\">last lecture</a>. You can watch it on <a href=\\\"http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/multimedia/randy-pausch-lecture.shtml\\\">Google Video here</a>. The reach of Randy's optimism is amazing. I know that millions of people have watched the lecture online, but I was really surprised to read about him in a local newspaper. Randy's positive perspective obviously has an impact and I think makes the world a better place.</p>\\n<p>You can find plenty of contrasts, watch the news, read the latest gossip on the internet, there are plenty of people in the world who have no shortage of resources - money, friends etc, but who still find little joy in life. In spite of their great success their perspective leaves them in a negative state. Which is why I started out talking about purple bracelets. Many of the participants in the purple bracelet story started out by ... complaining. \\\"How can you go 21 days without complaining,\\\" and \\\"it can't be healthy to keep all of that in.\\\" The interviewee pointed out that the point of the exercise isn't to bottle up anger it is to change perspective. It is easy to complain that someone did something to you or that you can't get along with that person. It is much harder to change your perspective and learn to work within the parameters that are part of your life, but he also said that generally people don't like to be around those who complain. The experience is negative for hte listener and will others will turn away from that. In contrast, we enjoy being around those who are positive. I remember in college I had a buddy that always had dates even though he was not especially remarkable in looks, money, brains etc. His greatest asset was his ability to be positive in any situation and that served him well.</p>\\n<p>I won't be getting a purple bracelet for myself or anyone I know. Bowen mentioned that it is common for individuals to buy the bracelet for people they know to get their friends to stop complaining, only to find out that they are the big complainer. I don't really need to find out what I already know that I need to stop complaining and be more positive.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-11-08-complaning-about-perspective/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/complaning-about-perspective\",\"date\":\"2007-11-08T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Complaning About Perspective\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Interesting\",\"life\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I grew up in southeast Idaho which is in close proximity to Jackson Hole, Wy and Grand Teton National Park.

Land values in the area are beyond absurd. I know this because as we drove through Tetonia and Driggs this last weekend I saw real estate signs bearing the name of Sotheby's. This is amusing to me because I associate Sotheby's with expensive art painted by eclectic dead guys, rare books and the fine and over priced things in life. During our drive I saw the name attached to run down gas stations with busted windows and rusting junk in the side lot. Another place bore a rusted sign swaying in the breeze reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock film. Until a few years ago you couldn't have paid someone to take over these places. They are run down and filled with junk, but now they are listed along side the crown jewels. We could never figure out how dry farmers - guys that plant crops and pray the rain will come - could survive. There are some large dry farms in the Teton Valley. I heard a rumor that a 3,000 acre one just sold for 18 million bucks. I am sure the developer has high hopes for golf courses and large cabins. He will probably succeed, but the land is crap. It's the place people tried to farm as a last resort and now it is becoming a resort. These aren't tree covered mountains.

It is likely this is the home they will stay in the rest of their lives. Some kids draw on the walls with crayon and some kids take off their diapers. It took a diabolical mind to combine the two and learn to draw on the walls with poop. We loaned our good friends some toddler beds so that they could use them for their children.

I love duct tape. I was helped with a surgery in the great outdoors that ended with the use of duct tape to ensure the patient's open wound stayed sealed shut perfectly protected by duct tape. It is an old trusty companion. You can fix anything and do anything with duct tape. These demon geniuses figured out how to defeat the greatest binding agent on earth and even the duct tape couldn't ensure the window would stay shut.</p>\\n<p>One day said friend put her boys down for a nap. A little while later the doorbell rang. Said friend sent her older daughter 6 years old to answer the front door. In front of her stood the two two year old boys. After defeating the duct tape they threw open the window, hurled a mattress out and then jumped the 8 feet down. After that they rang the front door.

Of course, I realize that is impossible unless my body has taken to depositing iron into my follicles (it could happen, haven't you seen X-Men 3 where that guy has spiking things come out of him?).</p>\\n<p>I had a physics class where one of the test questions was to explain <a href=\\\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/mri1.htm\\\">how an MRI works</a>. I retained some of that information. I did remember that hydrogen atoms are important in the process and the spin of the atom makes a difference. We are mostly water so the whole thing works out great for seeing just how gross you are on the inside. I also remember that in order to build a 2 Tesla magnet you have to super cool the wires with liquid helium that is something like -452 degrees Fahrenheit. There were a few moments when I envisioned that one James Bond movie where the guy stands up and yells \\\"I am invincible\\\" and then the tanks of liquid helium burst and turn him into a delicious cannibal tv dinner. I prayed that the Wasatch Front be preserved from earthquakes until my 20 minutes were up.</p>\\n<p>The how it works link above told me the experience would be loud. I figured it might be so I was ready, and they were kind enough to give me ear plugs. The machine I got cozy with for 20 minutes was apparently a connoisseur of heavy, loud punk rock played new age style. The sound and the volume were definitely punk. If at any point I had started yelling random obscenities I am pretty sure the album could go gold. However, the rhythm was very definitely new age. Think Yanni with piercings.</p>\\n<p>The experience was louder than any concert I have been to and my ears rung for a while afterward. In spite of that at several moments I had to smile and almost laugh because the noise is very rhythmic and very loud and I really wanted to start doing the air guitar thing. (The techs don't like that much because you are supposed to hold very still and hold your breath for 20 minutes. Besides the tube I was in was only 5 inches bigger than me and getting the licks right would be killer.)</p>\\n<p>In all I rate the experience very high. Next time you feel like buying a couple of U2 tickets from a scalper for $200 bucks consider the MRI experience instead.

However, I am sure he would rather spend his time designing a more fuel efficient engine or a cool stereo system. Wait, I said GM, I meant a big freaking SUV that burns more gas than many small countries.</p>\\n<p>It might be that back in high school the geeks, nerds, the computer guys were always taken advantage of. We were the guys that got picked last in sports and the main source for lunch money for the jocks. We played in the band or hung out with the chess club. Some of us were on academic 'teams' that competed in Jeopardy like contests to prove which school had the smartest nerds. We were nerds and because of that people figured they could take advantage of us.</p>\\n<p>Guess what. Now we own you. All your data. Your precious pictures. Your Word Docs (bleh). Everything.....\\nSorry. That was for a different article - world domination and all that. I still have a lot of pent up anger from losing some of those academic Jeopardy like 'competitions'.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, I am at lunch with friends the other day at this nice little pastry shop that also does sandwiches and salads. The owner is from Poland and everything in the store is authentic and absolutely amazing. I could gain a thousand pounds eating there every day. It is a place where we go to eat lunch, then indulge in some pastry and all the time engage in deep, academic conversation about the world and what is wrong in politics and the environment etc. It is a lunchtime escape where I get to hang out with very intelligent, very cool people. In the middle of chatting about a couple of upcoming funding opportunities I get a call from a guy that I haven't talked to in a year. Now, he is a great guy and a hard worker and etc. However, we aren't really close friends or anything. We don't do lunch. We don't get together with the spouses and shoot the bull. I know him from a professional setting - one in which he did work and I paid him for that work.</p>\\n<p>The call starts like this, \\\"Hi Justin, I'm having problems with my computer and you're the person I thought to call.\\\" If you are one of the computer savvy elite, that is not a compliment that is the sound of your lunch money about to disappear. I give him a bit of advice - try running a virus scanner. In general that is a good tip. Write it down. Unless you are a geek capable of setting up a firewall, locking down your home network and running Linux i.e. if you are normal person then in all likelihood you have several viruses, your Windows box calls a guy named Dimitry \\\"master\\\" and your computers are serving Russian porn, viagra emails or <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia\\\">are being used to attack network infrastructure in small countries</a>.</p>\\n<p>Ergo, every request to \\\"fix my computer\\\" should begin with \\\"run your virus scanner.\\\" That is usually a good out and a way to get them off the phone. Then you can ignore them when they call next time. If you are lucky they have a virus scanner. If you kicked a kitten on the way into work then darkness will overshadow you, they will not have a scanner and they will want to try to get you to second base with this line taken straight from my phone call:\\n\\\"I was wondering if you would like to come over to my house and look at my computers and see if you can fix them.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Typically, I am a nice guy. If a widow down the road has computer problems or if a local charity needs to piece together a wireless network then I am a sucker and there is no way I will refuse. If my mother calls me because the #$%! printer won't work then no matter what I am doing she gets my time and I have to walk her through how to plug in a USB cable.</p>\\n<p>However, if you are someone who is:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>To lazy to search Google for your problem and try to fix it yourself...</li>\\n<li>To cheap to pay a local shop to take a look at the virus you downloaded because you were surfing porn...</li>\\n<li>To cheap/not smart enough to have a virus scanner/malware scanner...</li>\\n<li>To lazy to call Dell tech support yourself (I don't love talking to people in India either)...</li>\\n<li>Have a computer from 1984 that you are trying to install Windows 95 on..</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Then no, I will not fix your #$%@!#$ computer.</p>\\n<p>Currently, I spend my day with my brain engaged to a level that at times I have almost vomited. I am not kidding. When I have a computer problem at work I take my computer to Trent (IT superstar at COSL) - he is nice and he is paid to help me, well sort of. I am sure after he reads I will end up running virus scanners. Anyway, when I have a computer problem at home I ask myself why am I still running Windows and then I reformat the computer. My wife's computer barely works most of the time and I really have to have a reason to work on a computer anymore - like there is smoke coming out of a drive (happened to a floppy drive of mine once). When I get home I spend a bit of time with my kids. They go to bed. My wife bids me farewell and then disappear into my office downstairs and write more code until I pass out and the drool pooling around my chin wakes me up sometime between 1 and 4 am.</p>\\n<p>So ya, I want to come to your house and work on your computer really bad. Even if you paid me the $150 an hour I have charged as a consultant (for jobs I really don't want to do) I still have no interest in working on your computer. None. It isn't interesting. It is painful and I know that not only do you not want to pay me but you are going to make me try to figure out a way for you to store all your digital photos from your brand new camera with a 4GB flash card on a 10 year old 500 MB hard drive because you are to to cheap and stupid to get the hardware you need to get the job done right. (You will also call me in tears when that 10 year old hard drive crashes and you lose all your precious memories of fluffy and the kids at the beach). <a href=\\\"/2007/09/24/how-to-manage-60000-digital-photos/\\\">I have a different rant on the managing digital photos/I don't want to hear you bawl if you lose your pictures.</a></p>\\n<p>What do you do when you get a request, \\\"to come over.\\\" Unless the request is coming from a member of the opposite sex who is really hot and who will spend ... wait my wife is going to read this ...\\nDo not enter the home of anyone who wants you to fix their computer. Not ever. You will still be there three days later. The favor will turn into, \\\"this is taking a long time, I and the wife are going to go out for dinner. Since you are going to be hear anyway you won't mind watching the kids will you?\\\"</p>\\n<p>Follow these tips and save yourself pain:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fake stupidity, tell them that you have run into the problem before, couldn't fix it and so had to reformat the computer. DO NOT offer to reformat. I have reformatted computers for people. They always say, \\\"there is nothing important on that computer. Just reformat.\\\" You explain that it will never come back, not ever. EVERYTHING will be lost. They say, \\\"That's fine. Just do whatever you need to to fix it.\\\" A week later you will get a call from that same person. They will either be in tears or totally irate because their recipes, email, 'borrowed' video games and other applications, pirated music, pictures, links to favorite [porn, gambling, viagra] websites and church knitting lists are all gone. \\\"I didn't mean that data, I meant it was OK to reformat all the bad stuff.\\\" Reformatting a computer for a friend means that you get paid nothing, but get the joy of taking all the liability for their data. Somehow they get the right to be pissed when it is all gone. Fake stupidity, fake a migraine, fake whatever you have to and do not offer to reformat.</li>\\n<li>You are very busy. You are a geek so you have a release deadline looming (with agile development everyday is a looming deadline so it isn't a lie). Tell them that you would love to help but you are working 100 hour weeks and just can't do it. There really isn't any risk of being found out because you are a geek so you don't go outside anyway.</li>\\n<li>Do not give them your real email or IM account. If you can get a new cell phone number. Give them the hotmail account you use when you are forced to register on annoying websites. Remember plausible deniability is a free gift from the spam filters.</li>\\n<li>I know you hate the Best Buy geek squad and/or the local computer shop because they are morons and you know way more than they do. However, THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS. You might have to practice saying this without bursting out laughing, but try:\\n\\\"You know, these new computers are just so complex. They are totally beyond me. Whenever I have a problem I just take my computer down to Best Buy/local shop and they fix it right up.\\\" I know, I had a hard time typing it, but that line can save you hours of pain.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>There you have it. My tips born of experience and anger.</p>\\n<p>I haven't always been like this. I was once a happy, naive, helpful computer guy. The anger comes from years of being suckered into being IT support for everyone who has breathed air within ten feet of me. In college I spent a Christmas break trying to fix a computer for a relative. Of course the printer wouldn't work with the computer because the computer was 10 years old and running some random form of DOS or Windows 3.1. No one ever wants to face the inevitable and realize that their computer is dead. No, they don't want to go spend a few bucks for a new machine, but they are more than happy to waste your entire day. I am sure someone will tell you that there is Karma in helping others. I came down with the flu almost as I was leaving from fixing that computer and spent a week puking my guts out.</p>\\n<p>In a previous area where I lived I had some neighbors ask me to help them out with a computer problem. Their computer was slow, took half an hour to boot, wouldn't run Microsoft Word, etc and they really wanted it to be able to play video games. I spent several hours working out the issues - problems caused because they didn't have virus software, they installed the wrong drivers, they run Windows etc. I hacked through each problems and removed a bunch of crap they had added. Then then asked about the video games. I told them they would need a new computer to run the kinds of games they wanted to play. \\\"Can't you make it run faster so that I can run World of Warcraft [on my 386]?\\\" Sure, I can just pull CPU cycles out of my ass. Upgrade the video card? No way that costs money. I spent about three hours tweaking on that stupid thing just to get it to a point where they could edit Word documents. Of course they wanted it fixed no matter how long it took and at any cost because well, it was my time and they weren't paying for it.</p>\\n<p>A few months later I was doing some electrical wiring. I was comfortable with most of it, but the wire was outside and I was unfamiliar with local codes. Plus I would have to wire into the big panel on the outside of the house and getting electrocuted is not an exciting prospect.</p>\\n<p>No worries, the guy I just helped with the computer is an electrician. This is great I think. Karma has smiled upon me. I call him up. He comes over. We get everything wired up. The sun is shining. It is a beautiful day. It takes about an hour and we are done.</p>\\n<p>\\\"That'll be 75 bucks, I usually charge $150 an hour but since you are a friend I'll do half today.\\\" I start thinking about how I should have made his computer make farting noises every time he opened the CDROM drive and I am really trying to understand how \\\"friend\\\" translates into \\\"sucker.\\\"</p>\\n<p>I pay him.</p>\\n<p>He had the nerve to call again because his computer was having problems. I told him to run a virus scanner.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-10-08-no-i-wont-fix-your-computer/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/no-i-wont-fix-your-computer\",\"date\":\"2007-10-08T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"No I Won&#8217;t Fix Your @!#$!@#$ Computer\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Computers\",\"Computers\",\"fix\",\"geek\",\"rant\"],\"image\":null}}}],\"pathPrefix\":\"archive\",\"first\":false,\"last\":false,\"index\":24,\"pageCount\":33,\"additionalContext\":{}}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---archive-24-9f22380aecc0b0ff486b.js","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{\"group\":[{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I am usually very good about approving comments - I don't get that many so it isn't hard.

Free hosting with one of the premier Ruby on Rails hosts.  I normally have to eat bags of M&#x26;Ms to be this happy.</p>\\n<p>Not all is roses.  There is a dark side to this free hosting.  Setting it up will make you want to cry.  I am a developer, not a Solaris system administrator and so getting my application deployed was like having a vasectomy and being totally conscious the entire time.  In hopes of saving time in the future for myself and others here is how to configure your Facebook Rails application for deployment via Capistrano on a Joyent Accelerator.  The ideas aren't mine.  I stole everything from all over the place.  I added links at the bottom where I found some of the information.  The rest of it I will just feel guilty about.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li> <a href=\\\"http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=12629\\\">Setup your shell for capistrano</a>.  Follow the link for the how and why.\\n   Note my $HOME/.ssh/environment file contains this:\\n    <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/ucb:\\n/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/csw/sbin:\\n/opt/csw/gnu:/opt/csw/gcc3/bin:/opt/csw/mysql5/bin:\\n/opt/csw/postgresql/bin:/opt/csw/apache2/bin:\\n/opt/csw/apache2/sbin\\n</pre></code>\\n  Also be careful so that you don't edit ssh_config instead of sshd_config not that anyone would ever be so stupid and do that.  :-)\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  Make sure you have the Capistrano gem installed on your local machine:\\n  <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">sudo gem install capistrano</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  capify your application:\\n   In the root of your rails application run this:\\n   <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">capify .</pre></code>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n  You will now have a deploy.rb in your config directory.  Replace it with this <a href='http://www.justinball.comdeploy.rb' title='deploy.rb'>deploy.rb</a>.\\nThen be sure to replace the XXXXXXXX with the username provided to you in your welcome email from Joyent.  Then look for the sections of deploy.rb that contain capital letters and enter in the relevant values.  These will include your application name, your domain name, and the path to your repository.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow create a directory inside your config directory and name accelerator.  Then add the following three files into it:\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comaccelerator_tasks.rb' title='accelerator_tasks.rb'>accelerator_tasks.rb - contains Capistrano recipes specific to the Joyent Accelerator.</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comapache_vhost.erb' title='apache_vhost.erb'>apache_vhost.erb - configures apache to point to your rails application</a>\\n<a href='http://www.justinball.comsmf_template.erb' title='smf_template.erb'>smf_template.erb - starts up mongrel automatically for you when you system starts</a>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow we need a mongrel_cluster.yml file.  Create a file called mongrel_cluster.yml inside of your config directory and put this in it:\\nport: \\\"8000\\\"\\nenvironment: production\\naddress: 127.0.0.1\\npid_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/pids/mongrel.pid\\nlog_file: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/shared/log/mongrel.log\\nservers: 3\\ndocroot: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current/public\\ncwd: /home/XXXXXXX/web/APP-NAME/current\\n<p>You will need to edit the paths to match the paths you setup in deploy.rb.  This likely means that you will need to replace XXXXXXX with your joyent username and APP-NAME with the name of your application.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nSubversion needs to know how to talk to your repository if it is password protected.  ssh into the server and do this inside your home directory:\\nsvn co PATH TO YOUR PROJECT\\nYou can delete the directory when it is done.  You do this so that your svn username and password are cached on the server which means that Capistrano will be able to checkout files.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nWhile you are logged into the server be sure to create an empty database.  The name should match the name in your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nBe sure to enter the proper username for root into your database.yml file.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nNow for the exciting part:\\nRun <pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">cap deploy:setup</pre></code> inside of the root of your Rails project.  It should run successfully.  If not I am very sorry.\\n</li>\\n<li>\\nThen do this:\\ncap deploy:cold\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\nYou should be up and running at that point.\\n<p>More helps and information:\\n<a href=\\\"http://wiki.joyent.com/facebook:kb:faststart\\\">Joyent's quickstart</a>.

I was listening to it last night on the way home and Will Bowen of <a href=\\\"http://ccunitykc.org/\\\">Christ Church Unity</a> was on talking about his <a href=\\\"http://allday.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/03/29/101595.aspx\\\">no complaint</a> for <a href=\\\"http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17362505/\\\">21 days program</a> and the purple bracelets he passes out to help people to remember not to complain. This morning on my way in they were talking to <a href=\\\"http://www.davidco.com/\\\">David Allen</a>, the author of \\\"Getting Things Done\\\". More than productivity David Allen the gist of Allen's interview for me was perspective.</p>\\n<p>Allen talked about how important it is to maintain perspective in life. At times we are forced to work with people we don't want to work with. Our relationships may not go the way we want them to go. Many of the parameters for our life are set for us so it is up to us to decide what to do with what we have. He made the point that many human beings in the most dire of circumstances still maintain a hopefully, happy perspective - it is the thing we have control over and the thing we can change. As we improve our perspective guess what, our lives improve. Call it Kharma or call it positive energy whatever. Positive people tend to have positive lives. (I don't count myself as a positive person generally).</p>\\n<p>A concrete example of someone in dire circumstances who has inspired people the world over is <a href=\\\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/\\\">Randy Pausch</a>. He is a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon. They have a\\nlast lecture' series. The point of which is for faculty to give a lecture as if it is their last. Unfortunately, Randy's last lecture really is his last. He is retiring because he has pancreatic cancer.\\nHe recently gave his <a href=\\\"http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/\\\">last lecture</a>. You can watch it on <a href=\\\"http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/multimedia/randy-pausch-lecture.shtml\\\">Google Video here</a>. The reach of Randy's optimism is amazing. I know that millions of people have watched the lecture online, but I was really surprised to read about him in a local newspaper. Randy's positive perspective obviously has an impact and I think makes the world a better place.</p>\\n<p>You can find plenty of contrasts, watch the news, read the latest gossip on the internet, there are plenty of people in the world who have no shortage of resources - money, friends etc, but who still find little joy in life. In spite of their great success their perspective leaves them in a negative state. Which is why I started out talking about purple bracelets. Many of the participants in the purple bracelet story started out by ... complaining. \\\"How can you go 21 days without complaining,\\\" and \\\"it can't be healthy to keep all of that in.\\\" The interviewee pointed out that the point of the exercise isn't to bottle up anger it is to change perspective. It is easy to complain that someone did something to you or that you can't get along with that person. It is much harder to change your perspective and learn to work within the parameters that are part of your life, but he also said that generally people don't like to be around those who complain. The experience is negative for hte listener and will others will turn away from that. In contrast, we enjoy being around those who are positive. I remember in college I had a buddy that always had dates even though he was not especially remarkable in looks, money, brains etc. His greatest asset was his ability to be positive in any situation and that served him well.</p>\\n<p>I won't be getting a purple bracelet for myself or anyone I know. Bowen mentioned that it is common for individuals to buy the bracelet for people they know to get their friends to stop complaining, only to find out that they are the big complainer. I don't really need to find out what I already know that I need to stop complaining and be more positive.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-11-08-complaning-about-perspective/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/complaning-about-perspective\",\"date\":\"2007-11-08T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Complaning About Perspective\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Interesting\",\"life\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I grew up in southeast Idaho which is in close proximity to Jackson Hole, Wy and Grand Teton National Park.

Land values in the area are beyond absurd. I know this because as we drove through Tetonia and Driggs this last weekend I saw real estate signs bearing the name of Sotheby's. This is amusing to me because I associate Sotheby's with expensive art painted by eclectic dead guys, rare books and the fine and over priced things in life. During our drive I saw the name attached to run down gas stations with busted windows and rusting junk in the side lot. Another place bore a rusted sign swaying in the breeze reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock film. Until a few years ago you couldn't have paid someone to take over these places. They are run down and filled with junk, but now they are listed along side the crown jewels. We could never figure out how dry farmers - guys that plant crops and pray the rain will come - could survive. There are some large dry farms in the Teton Valley. I heard a rumor that a 3,000 acre one just sold for 18 million bucks. I am sure the developer has high hopes for golf courses and large cabins. He will probably succeed, but the land is crap. It's the place people tried to farm as a last resort and now it is becoming a resort. These aren't tree covered mountains. This land is some farmer's field that just happens to have a line of site to the Teton range.

After finding the beds upside down and in various places throughout the room our friends asked if they could nail the beds to the baseboards (they really did it).</p>\\n<p>In an act of true evil genius for a pair of boys of only two they figured out how to open their bedroom window. Not wanting them to get hurt our good friends put a rod in the window to prevent it from opening. It only took an hour or so before they figured out how to remove that. Then it was on to duct tape. I love duct tape. I was helped with a surgery in the great outdoors that ended with the use of duct tape to ensure the patient's open wound stayed sealed shut perfectly protected by duct tape. It is an old trusty companion. You can fix anything and do anything with duct tape. These demon geniuses figured out how to defeat the greatest binding agent on earth and even the duct tape couldn't ensure the window would stay shut.</p>\\n<p>One day said friend put her boys down for a nap. A little while later the doorbell rang. Said friend sent her older daughter 6 years old to answer the front door. In front of her stood the two two year old boys. After defeating the duct tape they threw open the window, hurled a mattress out and then jumped the 8 feet down. After that they rang the front door. I think we should all be glad they didn't try to hitch a ride to Las Vegas.</p>\\n<p>So no, my son will not ever play with the spawn of Satan.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-10-17-the-spawn-of-satan/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/the-spawn-of-satan\",\"date\":\"2007-10-17T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"The Spawn of Satan\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Family\",\"Friends\",\"friends\",\"kids\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I had my first chance to lay inside a claustrophobic MRI machine today so that I could celebrate Halloween in style with an authentic skeleton costume.

The good news is that I am not dying or anything, and I now know what a gazillion watts of electricity buzzing around my head sounds like.</p>\\n<p>The process is painless. You don't feel anything. However, I could have sworn that I felt the hair on my arm stand on end at one point. Of course, I realize that is impossible unless my body has taken to depositing iron into my follicles (it could happen, haven't you seen X-Men 3 where that guy has spiking things come out of him?).</p>\\n<p>I had a physics class where one of the test questions was to explain <a href=\\\"http://www.howstuffworks.com/mri1.htm\\\">how an MRI works</a>. I retained some of that information. I did remember that hydrogen atoms are important in the process and the spin of the atom makes a difference. We are mostly water so the whole thing works out great for seeing just how gross you are on the inside. I also remember that in order to build a 2 Tesla magnet you have to super cool the wires with liquid helium that is something like -452 degrees Fahrenheit. There were a few moments when I envisioned that one James Bond movie where the guy stands up and yells \\\"I am invincible\\\" and then the tanks of liquid helium burst and turn him into a delicious cannibal tv dinner. I prayed that the Wasatch Front be preserved from earthquakes until my 20 minutes were up.</p>\\n<p>The how it works link above told me the experience would be loud. I figured it might be so I was ready, and they were kind enough to give me ear plugs. The machine I got cozy with for 20 minutes was apparently a connoisseur of heavy, loud punk rock played new age style. The sound and the volume were definitely punk. If at any point I had started yelling random obscenities I am pretty sure the album could go gold. However, the rhythm was very definitely new age. Think Yanni with piercings.</p>\\n<p>The experience was louder than any concert I have been to and my ears rung for a while afterward. In spite of that at several moments I had to smile and almost laugh because the noise is very rhythmic and very loud and I really wanted to start doing the air guitar thing. (The techs don't like that much because you are supposed to hold very still and hold your breath for 20 minutes. Besides the tube I was in was only 5 inches bigger than me and getting the licks right would be killer.)</p>\\n<p>In all I rate the experience very high. Next time you feel like buying a couple of U2 tickets from a scalper for $200 bucks consider the MRI experience instead. It costs the same and after you get the mini air guitar thing right you will thank me.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-10-17-an-mri-is-like-a-rock-concert/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/an-mri-is-like-a-rock-concert\",\"date\":\"2007-10-17T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"An MRI is Like a Rock Concert\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"back problems\",\"medicine\",\"MRI\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I am a software engineer.

It means I can talk about servers and argue about what programming languages are best (<a href=\\\"/2006/07/29/pph-profanity-per-hour/\\\">Check out PPH for the standard measure for programming languages.</a>) It means I can build a cool website or write scripts that help my wife manage photos. Do something annoying and I can hack your computer and make it belch every time you open the CDROM Drive. (Don't piss me off or it can get uglier).</p>\\n<p>One thing I will not do is fix your computer.</p>\\n<p>I know there are a lot of you out there that fall into the same 'known geek' category. You are the guy that gets introduced as 'knowing about computers'. The typical response from the party hearing this is, \\\"great, now I know who to call when I have problems.\\\"</p>\\n<p>No you don't.</p>\\n<p>Asking a software engineer to fix your computer is like asking a GM automobile engineer to come over and look at your 1983 Volvo because it is leaking oil. Sure he understands the basics - cars have engines and oil pans and lots of tubes and stuff, and yes because he understands the general concept he can probably fix it. However, I am sure he would rather spend his time designing a more fuel efficient engine or a cool stereo system. Wait, I said GM, I meant a big freaking SUV that burns more gas than many small countries.</p>\\n<p>It might be that back in high school the geeks, nerds, the computer guys were always taken advantage of. We were the guys that got picked last in sports and the main source for lunch money for the jocks. We played in the band or hung out with the chess club. Some of us were on academic 'teams' that competed in Jeopardy like contests to prove which school had the smartest nerds. We were nerds and because of that people figured they could take advantage of us.</p>\\n<p>Guess what. Now we own you. All your data. Your precious pictures. Your Word Docs (bleh). Everything.....\\nSorry. That was for a different article - world domination and all that. I still have a lot of pent up anger from losing some of those academic Jeopardy like 'competitions'.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, I am at lunch with friends the other day at this nice little pastry shop that also does sandwiches and salads. The owner is from Poland and everything in the store is authentic and absolutely amazing. I could gain a thousand pounds eating there every day. It is a place where we go to eat lunch, then indulge in some pastry and all the time engage in deep, academic conversation about the world and what is wrong in politics and the environment etc. It is a lunchtime escape where I get to hang out with very intelligent, very cool people. In the middle of chatting about a couple of upcoming funding opportunities I get a call from a guy that I haven't talked to in a year. Now, he is a great guy and a hard worker and etc. However, we aren't really close friends or anything. We don't do lunch. We don't get together with the spouses and shoot the bull. I know him from a professional setting - one in which he did work and I paid him for that work.</p>\\n<p>The call starts like this, \\\"Hi Justin, I'm having problems with my computer and you're the person I thought to call.\\\" If you are one of the computer savvy elite, that is not a compliment that is the sound of your lunch money about to disappear. I give him a bit of advice - try running a virus scanner. In general that is a good tip. Write it down. Unless you are a geek capable of setting up a firewall, locking down your home network and running Linux i.e. if you are normal person then in all likelihood you have several viruses, your Windows box calls a guy named Dimitry \\\"master\\\" and your computers are serving Russian porn, viagra emails or <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia\\\">are being used to attack network infrastructure in small countries</a>.</p>\\n<p>Ergo, every request to \\\"fix my computer\\\" should begin with \\\"run your virus scanner.\\\" That is usually a good out and a way to get them off the phone. Then you can ignore them when they call next time. If you are lucky they have a virus scanner. If you kicked a kitten on the way into work then darkness will overshadow you, they will not have a scanner and they will want to try to get you to second base with this line taken straight from my phone call:\\n\\\"I was wondering if you would like to come over to my house and look at my computers and see if you can fix them.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Typically, I am a nice guy. If a widow down the road has computer problems or if a local charity needs to piece together a wireless network then I am a sucker and there is no way I will refuse. If my mother calls me because the #$%! printer won't work then no matter what I am doing she gets my time and I have to walk her through how to plug in a USB cable.</p>\\n<p>However, if you are someone who is:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>To lazy to search Google for your problem and try to fix it yourself...</li>\\n<li>To cheap to pay a local shop to take a look at the virus you downloaded because you were surfing porn...</li>\\n<li>To cheap/not smart enough to have a virus scanner/malware scanner...</li>\\n<li>To lazy to call Dell tech support yourself (I don't love talking to people in India either)...</li>\\n<li>Have a computer from 1984 that you are trying to install Windows 95 on..</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Then no, I will not fix your #$%@!#$ computer.</p>\\n<p>Currently, I spend my day with my brain engaged to a level that at times I have almost vomited. I am not kidding. When I have a computer problem at work I take my computer to Trent (IT superstar at COSL) - he is nice and he is paid to help me, well sort of. I am sure after he reads I will end up running virus scanners. Anyway, when I have a computer problem at home I ask myself why am I still running Windows and then I reformat the computer. My wife's computer barely works most of the time and I really have to have a reason to work on a computer anymore - like there is smoke coming out of a drive (happened to a floppy drive of mine once). When I get home I spend a bit of time with my kids. They go to bed. My wife bids me farewell and then disappear into my office downstairs and write more code until I pass out and the drool pooling around my chin wakes me up sometime between 1 and 4 am.</p>\\n<p>So ya, I want to come to your house and work on your computer really bad. Even if you paid me the $150 an hour I have charged as a consultant (for jobs I really don't want to do) I still have no interest in working on your computer. None. It isn't interesting. It is painful and I know that not only do you not want to pay me but you are going to make me try to figure out a way for you to store all your digital photos from your brand new camera with a 4GB flash card on a 10 year old 500 MB hard drive because you are to to cheap and stupid to get the hardware you need to get the job done right. (You will also call me in tears when that 10 year old hard drive crashes and you lose all your precious memories of fluffy and the kids at the beach). <a href=\\\"/2007/09/24/how-to-manage-60000-digital-photos/\\\">I have a different rant on the managing digital photos/I don't want to hear you bawl if you lose your pictures.</a></p>\\n<p>What do you do when you get a request, \\\"to come over.\\\" Unless the request is coming from a member of the opposite sex who is really hot and who will spend ... wait my wife is going to read this ...\\nDo not enter the home of anyone who wants you to fix their computer. Not ever. You will still be there three days later. The favor will turn into, \\\"this is taking a long time, I and the wife are going to go out for dinner. Since you are going to be hear anyway you won't mind watching the kids will you?\\\"</p>\\n<p>Follow these tips and save yourself pain:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fake stupidity, tell them that you have run into the problem before, couldn't fix it and so had to reformat the computer. DO NOT offer to reformat. I have reformatted computers for people. They always say, \\\"there is nothing important on that computer. Just reformat.\\\" You explain that it will never come back, not ever. EVERYTHING will be lost. They say, \\\"That's fine. Just do whatever you need to to fix it.\\\" A week later you will get a call from that same person. They will either be in tears or totally irate because their recipes, email, 'borrowed' video games and other applications, pirated music, pictures, links to favorite [porn, gambling, viagra] websites and church knitting lists are all gone. \\\"I didn't mean that data, I meant it was OK to reformat all the bad stuff.\\\" Reformatting a computer for a friend means that you get paid nothing, but get the joy of taking all the liability for their data. Somehow they get the right to be pissed when it is all gone. Fake stupidity, fake a migraine, fake whatever you have to and do not offer to reformat.</li>\\n<li>You are very busy. You are a geek so you have a release deadline looming (with agile development everyday is a looming deadline so it isn't a lie). Tell them that you would love to help but you are working 100 hour weeks and just can't do it. There really isn't any risk of being found out because you are a geek so you don't go outside anyway.</li>\\n<li>Do not give them your real email or IM account. If you can get a new cell phone number. Give them the hotmail account you use when you are forced to register on annoying websites. Remember plausible deniability is a free gift from the spam filters.</li>\\n<li>I know you hate the Best Buy geek squad and/or the local computer shop because they are morons and you know way more than they do. However, THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS. You might have to practice saying this without bursting out laughing, but try:\\n\\\"You know, these new computers are just so complex. They are totally beyond me. Whenever I have a problem I just take my computer down to Best Buy/local shop and they fix it right up.\\\" I know, I had a hard time typing it, but that line can save you hours of pain.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>There you have it. My tips born of experience and anger.</p>\\n<p>I haven't always been like this. I was once a happy, naive, helpful computer guy. The anger comes from years of being suckered into being IT support for everyone who has breathed air within ten feet of me. In college I spent a Christmas break trying to fix a computer for a relative. Of course the printer wouldn't work with the computer because the computer was 10 years old and running some random form of DOS or Windows 3.1. No one ever wants to face the inevitable and realize that their computer is dead. No, they don't want to go spend a few bucks for a new machine, but they are more than happy to waste your entire day. I am sure someone will tell you that there is Karma in helping others. I came down with the flu almost as I was leaving from fixing that computer and spent a week puking my guts out.</p>\\n<p>In a previous area where I lived I had some neighbors ask me to help them out with a computer problem. Their computer was slow, took half an hour to boot, wouldn't run Microsoft Word, etc and they really wanted it to be able to play video games. I spent several hours working out the issues - problems caused because they didn't have virus software, they installed the wrong drivers, they run Windows etc. I hacked through each problems and removed a bunch of crap they had added. Then then asked about the video games. I told them they would need a new computer to run the kinds of games they wanted to play. \\\"Can't you make it run faster so that I can run World of Warcraft [on my 386]?\\\" Sure, I can just pull CPU cycles out of my ass. Upgrade the video card? No way that costs money. I spent about three hours tweaking on that stupid thing just to get it to a point where they could edit Word documents. Of course they wanted it fixed no matter how long it took and at any cost because well, it was my time and they weren't paying for it.</p>\\n<p>A few months later I was doing some electrical wiring. I was comfortable with most of it, but the wire was outside and I was unfamiliar with local codes. Plus I would have to wire into the big panel on the outside of the house and getting electrocuted is not an exciting prospect.</p>\\n<p>No worries, the guy I just helped with the computer is an electrician. This is great I think. Karma has smiled upon me. I call him up. He comes over. We get everything wired up. The sun is shining. It is a beautiful day. It takes about an hour and we are done.</p>\\n<p>\\\"That'll be 75 bucks, I usually charge $150 an hour but since you are a friend I'll do half today.\\\" I start thinking about how I should have made his computer make farting noises every time he opened the CDROM drive and I am really trying to understand how \\\"friend\\\" translates into \\\"sucker.\\\"</p>\\n<p>I pay him.</p>\\n<p>He had the nerve to call again because his computer was having problems. I told him to run a virus scanner.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-10-08-no-i-wont-fix-your-computer/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/no-i-wont-fix-your-computer\",\"date\":\"2007-10-08T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"No I Won&#8217;t Fix Your @!#$!@#$ Computer\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Computers\",\"Computers\",\"fix\",\"geek\",\"rant\"],\"image\":null}}}],\"pathPrefix\":\"archive\",\"first\":false,\"last\":false,\"index\":24,\"pageCount\":33,\"additionalContext\":{}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/archive-24.json\n// module id = 1811\n// module chunks = 53930667326339"],"sourceRoot":""}
