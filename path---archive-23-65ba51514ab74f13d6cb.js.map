We don't really have a gazillion house plans, but sometime it feels like it and being able to manage all the house plans and the related images is not a trivial task.</p>\\n<p>Last night I updated the main styles pages so they are looking a bit better in my humble opinion. Granted, I am not a designer so I'll let you be the judge. I updated our <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com/country-house-plans\\\" title=\\\"View Country House Plans\\\">Country House Plans</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com/arts-and-crafts-house-plans\\\" title=\\\"View Arts and Crafts House Plans\\\">Arts and Crafts House Plans</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com/victorian-house-plans\\\" title=\\\"view Victorian House Plans\\\">Victorian House Plans</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com/luxury-house-plans\\\" title=\\\"View Luxury House Plans\\\">Luxury House Plans</a> pages. Take a look and let me know what you think.</p>\\n<p>One of the most interesting parts of building out these new part of the system is the updates I have made to the image processing code. All the images are generated on the fly from a set of core images. There are a couple of things that I find amazing and very convenient about this. The amazing part is that the image processing is very fast. After the first image generation the file is cached so that helps and if I need to regenerate all the images on the site I only need to delete the image cache folder. The convenient part is that we are able to generate images of all sizes, and quality and we can vary background colors if we are doing an image fit. That way if we don't like what the images look like I can tweak a few settings and the change is reflected across all the images which number somewhere in the 500,000 range.</p>\\n<p>Pretty cool.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-01-23-a-late-night-updating-house-plans-on-theplancollectioncom/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/a-late-night-updating-house-plans-on-theplancollectioncom\",\"date\":\"2008-01-23T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"A Gazillion House Plans on ThePlanCollection.com\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"The Plan Collection\",\"ASP.Net\",\"house plans\",\"image processing\",\"Programming\",\"The Plan Collection\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I created a code generator that writes all the of the code that connects  ThePlanCollection.com  website with its database.

Ok maybe I can share.   :-)\\\">ThePlanCollection.com</a> wasn't working so I started digging into the problem. It turns out that there is a bug in the generator and I am sure there are many more. The problem is that C# won't let you set DateTime values or Guids to null. That is very lame. So in my code I have to create a member variable that indicates the value is supposed to be null so that it can be passed to the database as null. One of those checks was happening when it didn't need to so in spite of passing in a value the check looked at the member variable which indicated the value should be null and so viola the value went to the database as null.</p>\\n<p>I take some of the blame here. I should have caught this bug. I should have known not to change a default value a week ago. However, ultimately I blame this on the !@#$ morons at M$.

They have computers and email. (One senator from Cache Valley is quoted as saying he would use his as a step ladder to help him get up on his horse - true story.)</p>\\n<p>Luckily they have moved a step further. <a href=\\\"http://www.senatesite.com/senatesight.html\\\"> The Senate has a webcam</a> and a <a href=\\\"http://www.senatesite.com/blog/\\\">Senate blog</a>.

No one will remember to keep submitting it anyway and since your entries in the products section of Google Base can expire it is important that you continually resubmit your products.</p>\\n<p>So I wrote a class to handle the Google Base stuff and then I put it into a Windows Service.  I figured as long as I was at it I would also write a service that can write out our site maps at the same time.</p>\\n<p>The site maps service starts fine.  The Google Base service starts then dies and drops this in the logs:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nEventType clr20r3, P1 r3b0434webwhcosy0o40t3c1xyqmvmpy, P2 1.0.0.0, P3 47803796, P4\\ntheplancollectionbackgroundservices, P5 1.0.0.0, P6 47803796, P7 16, P8 3e, P9 system.io.filenotfoundexception, P10 NIL.\\n\\nFor more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Since that message is so very helpful the problem is miserable to solve.  A Google search reveals that <a href=\\\"http://blogs.msdn.com/elton/archive/2006/03/06/545090.aspx\\\">I am not the only one with this problem</a>.  <a href=\\\"http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=328111&SiteID=1&mode=1\\\">Here is thread where others are feeling the M$ pain.</a></p>\\n<p>It appears that this error shows up for a great many reasons.  In my case I first ran the Windows Update to ensure I had the latest .Net framework.  I read that that helped others.  It didn't seem to make a difference.  I am using the Google Base .Net api.  I figured that I had spent enough of the day trying new vulgarities so I ran the SDK installer on the server.  Like magic my service now works.  I don't usually like to run SDK installers on servers so I then removed it and figured that I might need to install the one dll that I am using into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  I didn't.  The service still runs just fine.  The installer must leave something behind that keeps let's the service run.  I am betting there is some registry configuration somewhere that was changed and not reverted.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the most frustrating parts of development.  I would say it is because Windows is terrible or something, but all OSs share this same problem.  On Windows it is the registry on Linux it is dependency hell and on the Mac they pretend to be *nix so a lot of stuff works, but then right when you think you have that latest package ready to compile you find out that the smart boys at Apple decided to change the way something functions or they decided it would be OK to move things around.</p>\\n<p>Computers are painful.

All the images are generated on the fly from a set of core images. There are a couple of things that I find amazing and very convenient about this. The amazing part is that the image processing is very fast. After the first image generation the file is cached so that helps and if I need to regenerate all the images on the site I only need to delete the image cache folder. The convenient part is that we are able to generate images of all sizes, and quality and we can vary background colors if we are doing an image fit.

No one will remember to keep submitting it anyway and since your entries in the products section of Google Base can expire it is important that you continually resubmit your products.</p>\\n<p>So I wrote a class to handle the Google Base stuff and then I put it into a Windows Service.  I figured as long as I was at it I would also write a service that can write out our site maps at the same time.</p>\\n<p>The site maps service starts fine.  The Google Base service starts then dies and drops this in the logs:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nEventType clr20r3, P1 r3b0434webwhcosy0o40t3c1xyqmvmpy, P2 1.0.0.0, P3 47803796, P4\\ntheplancollectionbackgroundservices, P5 1.0.0.0, P6 47803796, P7 16, P8 3e, P9 system.io.filenotfoundexception, P10 NIL.\\n\\nFor more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Since that message is so very helpful the problem is miserable to solve.

In my case I first ran the Windows Update to ensure I had the latest .Net framework.  I read that that helped others.  It didn't seem to make a difference.  I am using the Google Base .Net api.  I figured that I had spent enough of the day trying new vulgarities so I ran the SDK installer on the server.  Like magic my service now works.  I don't usually like to run SDK installers on servers so I then removed it and figured that I might need to install the one dll that I am using into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).  I didn't.  The service still runs just fine.  The installer must leave something behind that keeps let's the service run.  I am betting there is some registry configuration somewhere that was changed and not reverted.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the most frustrating parts of development.  I would say it is because Windows is terrible or something, but all OSs share this same problem.  On Windows it is the registry on Linux it is dependency hell and on the Mac they pretend to be *nix so a lot of stuff works, but then right when you think you have that latest package ready to compile you find out that the smart boys at Apple decided to change the way something functions or they decided it would be OK to move things around.</p>\\n<p>Computers are painful.
