When I got back the shoulder strap had a huge tear in it. I'm not especially rough on bags. I basically carried the thing around. The first time I called Expercom they told me that I needed to work it out with the company. However, the next day I got a call from the owner. He told me to just bring it in and they would take care of it. I took it in today. They didn't have a similar bag to replace it with so they gave me credit for the torn bag and a discount on a BrentHaven bag. Its nice to have guys that will take care of you.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Thanks Expercom",date:"November 12, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/thanks-expercom"}}}});
