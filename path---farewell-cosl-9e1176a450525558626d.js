I wasn't sure exactly when it would expire, but last Friday basically became my last day. I know that there have been various issues surrounding the center, but think what you may it would be hard to find a gathering of more intelligent and talented people. Game night has been an extension of our daily work and will continue to be a gathering of the best minds. It has provided myself and each of my colleagues an outlet and a proof that COSL was more than just a place to work. I think most organizations struggle to develop within the kind of comradeship that grew organically from mutual respect and friendship.</p>\n<p>It has been a long time since I was part of such a gifted group of individuals.
