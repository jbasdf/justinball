This year was the last. Alfred William Ball was my great grandfather. This many years later the family has gotten so large that I don\'t really know/recognize anyone. For that very reason I was very careful who I dated in high school and I went out of state to find a wife.</p>\n<p>I have always wondered about my ancestors. As far as I knew no one had any information about their lives. By total luck I talked with the one person at the reunion who just happened to mention that she found this website for the <a href="http://weightfamily.net/Pioneers/Default.htm">Weight Family</a>. It has some information about where the Ball family came from. These types of discoveries are why I love the internet.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Last Alfred William Ball Family Reunion &#8211; 57 Years",date:"August 17, 2008",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
