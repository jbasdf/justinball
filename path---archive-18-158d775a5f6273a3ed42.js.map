Almost any day of the week he can be seen riding his bike around town. He has a horn on it that he honks and he waves at every passerby. He is always happy and every time I see him not matter how crappy my day has been I have to wave back. This one individual brightens up the entire community.</p>\\n<p>When the Olympics came to Utah the torch relay came through Logan. It wasn't the mayor, or the university president or some CEO that carried the torch on its arrival. Instead, to the cheer of thousands of onlookers the torch was carried in by Brent Carpenter. They couldn't have picked a better person. As far as I am concerned he does more for the well being and happiness of the community each day than most of our leaders combined.</p>\\n<p>I contrast this event with the torch relay this year. Rather than being an inspirational event that brings people together <a href=\\\"http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/olympic_torch_used_to\\\">it has become a symbol of human rights violations</a>. (Yes, I know its the onion). World leaders are being encouraged to boycott the opening ceremony. A while back I heard that athletes were being asked to boycott as well. I can't imagine anything more unfair to those who sacrifice a great deal and only get a few chances to display their talents to the world. If a point was to be made it should have been made by the Olympic Committee. They selected China knowing China's human rights record. Don't ask the athletes to sacrifice now because of the committee's poor choices.</p>\\n<p>However, having said that on the way home today I was listening to NPR. The newscasters were interviewing a Canadian government employee in charge of business relations with China. They are headed to meet with Chinese officials this next week to discuss trade. All during the conversation the newscasters would bait the individual with questions relating to China and human rights. Each time the person would respond with \\\"We aren't in charge of such matters. The federal government sets policy and it is not our job to engage in diplomatic relations regarding anything outside the scope of business development.\\\" I don't blame the individual for the statement. I think that is the attitude most of us share. We like to be able to purchase cheap stuff. Walmart has made it easy for us to consume large quantities of items from China. Our lifestyle now depends on cheap exports from the far east. We now share an unhealthy, symbiotic relationship relationship with China. They ensure we have a comfortable and cheap lifestyle and we give them lots of money. Our trade deficit with China runs about one billion dollars a day.</p>\\n<p>Do the sins of the Chinese government bleed onto our hands? I don't know. We provide a powerful economic engine via the dollars we vote with. We love democracy and freedom. I don't think any good American would ever think or say that it is a good thing for China to occupy Tibet or imprison political dissidents but it is easy to silence our values with <a href=\\\"http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=130306\\\">rollback savings</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-09-happy-smiley-guy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/happy-smiley-guy\",\"date\":\"2008-04-09T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Happy Smiley Guy\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"One of the most difficult tasks when putting up a new site is picking the right host.

Moving hosts later on is terribly difficult so choosing the correct hosting company is as important as selecting a business partner. <a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us/jbasdf/hosting\\\">I've collected about 30 hosting companies in my delicious bookmarks</a>. Some are specific to a platform others are really cheap. I recorded them because they looked interesting.</p>\\n<p>The latest movement in web hosting is towards cloud hosting. This is the holy grail for the user and for the hosting company. Imagine a web host that scales as you grow. Everyone would love nothing more than a host that could handle getting slammed by Digg.</p>\\n<p>Amazon's ec2 service offers scalable services, but it is not a simple as your typical web hosting company. <a href=\\\"http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/\\\">The Ruby gem ec2onrails</a> will simplify the process of getting your Ruby on Rails application up an running. <a href=\\\"http://www.rightscale.com/m/\\\">RightScale</a> builds on ec2 to make it easy to deploy your application. They add a dashboard and make it easy to load balance and bring up new instances. However, at a starting price of $500 a month and a $2500 setup fee they aren't cheap. <a href=\\\"http://www.elastra.com/\\\">Elastra</a> is another cloud computing service. They claim to not have setup fees, but I can't find a price on their site. The real advantage to these services beyond scaling really needs to be cost. Paying for what you use can be great, but can also be a bit scary. If you site takes off all of a sudden you might get stuck with a rather large bill, but hey at least your server didn't go down.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mosso.com/\\\">Mosso</a> has the ability to let you host linux or windows. At $100 a month their price is reasonable and they can scale up depending on how many requests you make. <a href=\\\"http://www.3tera.com/\\\">3Tera</a> claims they can 'scale from a fraction of a server to hundreds of CPUs in days'. They also claim that you won't need to change your application code.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http://www.bluehost.com\\\">Bluehost.com</a> hosting space ($6-$7) isn't going away anytime soon. However, the future of scalable applications I think lies with cloud computing.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\\\"http://eedious.blogspot.com/\\\">Alain Benedict</a> I am adding <a href=\\\"http://morphexchange.com/\\\">Morph</a> to the list of services.

They have a deal that requires you to buy 20 items from a certain list of participating items. I hit the 'fence' after I selected 20 items. I would have added more but wasn't sure if that meant I had to buy another 20 items to get the deal. Since I only wanted 3 or 4 more items not another 20 I stopped at 20. The business failed to communicate and in effect fenced me off from purchasing more items.</p>\\n<p>Websites have fences as well.

I am sure there were many others who didn't present who should also make this list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://blog.fallingsnow.net/\\\">Evan Phoenix</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.confreaks.com/videos/90-mwrc2008-strengthening-the-ruby-ecosystem-part-i-rubinius\\\">Strengthening the Ruby Ecosystem</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://brainspl.at/\\\">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.confreaks.com/videos/817-mwrc2008-strengthening-the-ruby-ecosystem-part-ii-merb\\\">Merb Presentation</a> <a href=\\\"http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/03/29/mountain-west-rubyconf-merb-slides\\\">Merb Slides</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/\\\">Giles Bowkett</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/\\\">Patrick Farley</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://onestepback.org/\\\">Jim Weirich</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://ph7spot.com/\\\">Philippe Hanrigou</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.yehudakatz.com/\\\">Yehuda Katz</a> <a href=\\\"http://datamapper.org/\\\">DataMapper</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.jeremymcanally.com/\\\">Jeremy McAnally</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://objo.com/\\\">Joe O'Brien</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://tammersaleh.com/\\\">Tammer Saleh\\n</a><a href=\\\"http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda\\\">Shoulda Testing Framework</a>.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.daikini.com/\\\" title=\\\"[Conference videos can be found here.][19]\\\">Jonathan Younger</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jan.prima.de/\\\">Jan Lehnardt</a> gets added for <a href=\\\"http://couchdb.org\\\">CouchDB </a> even though it isn't technically Ruby.</p>\\n<p>The presentations were about learning to think differently about Ruby and how to really take advantage of the elegance of the language. Ruby is swift and agile. You can do amazing things with just a few lines of code. The hard part is figuring out the few lines of code. Once your mindset meshes with this new paradigm of development you become far more effective than you ever thought possible in other languages.</p>\\n<p>I sat in the hackfest room sponsored by <a href=\\\"http://www.engineyard.com/blog\\\">EngineYard</a> and enjoyed listening to the experiences of a lot of great programmers.

Almost any day of the week he can be seen riding his bike around town. He has a horn on it that he honks and he waves at every passerby. He is always happy and every time I see him not matter how crappy my day has been I have to wave back. This one individual brightens up the entire community.</p>\\n<p>When the Olympics came to Utah the torch relay came through Logan. It wasn't the mayor, or the university president or some CEO that carried the torch on its arrival. Instead, to the cheer of thousands of onlookers the torch was carried in by Brent Carpenter. They couldn't have picked a better person. As far as I am concerned he does more for the well being and happiness of the community each day than most of our leaders combined.</p>\\n<p>I contrast this event with the torch relay this year. Rather than being an inspirational event that brings people together <a href=\\\"http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/olympic_torch_used_to\\\">it has become a symbol of human rights violations</a>. (Yes, I know its the onion). World leaders are being encouraged to boycott the opening ceremony. A while back I heard that athletes were being asked to boycott as well. I can't imagine anything more unfair to those who sacrifice a great deal and only get a few chances to display their talents to the world. If a point was to be made it should have been made by the Olympic Committee. They selected China knowing China's human rights record. Don't ask the athletes to sacrifice now because of the committee's poor choices.</p>\\n<p>However, having said that on the way home today I was listening to NPR. The newscasters were interviewing a Canadian government employee in charge of business relations with China. They are headed to meet with Chinese officials this next week to discuss trade. All during the conversation the newscasters would bait the individual with questions relating to China and human rights. Each time the person would respond with \\\"We aren't in charge of such matters. The federal government sets policy and it is not our job to engage in diplomatic relations regarding anything outside the scope of business development.\\\" I don't blame the individual for the statement. I think that is the attitude most of us share. We like to be able to purchase cheap stuff. Walmart has made it easy for us to consume large quantities of items from China. Our lifestyle now depends on cheap exports from the far east. We now share an unhealthy, symbiotic relationship relationship with China. They ensure we have a comfortable and cheap lifestyle and we give them lots of money. Our trade deficit with China runs about one billion dollars a day.</p>\\n<p>Do the sins of the Chinese government bleed onto our hands? I don't know. We provide a powerful economic engine via the dollars we vote with. We love democracy and freedom. I don't think any good American would ever think or say that it is a good thing for China to occupy Tibet or imprison political dissidents but it is easy to silence our values with <a href=\\\"http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=130306\\\">rollback savings</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-09-happy-smiley-guy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/happy-smiley-guy\",\"date\":\"2008-04-09T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Happy Smiley Guy\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"One of the most difficult tasks when putting up a new site is picking the right host.

Moving hosts later on is terribly difficult so choosing the correct hosting company is as important as selecting a business partner. <a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us/jbasdf/hosting\\\">I've collected about 30 hosting companies in my delicious bookmarks</a>. Some are specific to a platform others are really cheap. I recorded them because they looked interesting.</p>\\n<p>The latest movement in web hosting is towards cloud hosting. This is the holy grail for the user and for the hosting company. Imagine a web host that scales as you grow. Everyone would love nothing more than a host that could handle getting slammed by Digg.</p>\\n<p>Amazon's ec2 service offers scalable services, but it is not a simple as your typical web hosting company. <a href=\\\"http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/\\\">The Ruby gem ec2onrails</a> will simplify the process of getting your Ruby on Rails application up an running. <a href=\\\"http://www.rightscale.com/m/\\\">RightScale</a> builds on ec2 to make it easy to deploy your application. They add a dashboard and make it easy to load balance and bring up new instances. However, at a starting price of $500 a month and a $2500 setup fee they aren't cheap. <a href=\\\"http://www.elastra.com/\\\">Elastra</a> is another cloud computing service. They claim to not have setup fees, but I can't find a price on their site. The real advantage to these services beyond scaling really needs to be cost. Paying for what you use can be great, but can also be a bit scary. If you site takes off all of a sudden you might get stuck with a rather large bill, but hey at least your server didn't go down.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mosso.com/\\\">Mosso</a> has the ability to let you host linux or windows. At $100 a month their price is reasonable and they can scale up depending on how many requests you make. <a href=\\\"http://www.3tera.com/\\\">3Tera</a> claims they can 'scale from a fraction of a server to hundreds of CPUs in days'.

They have a deal that requires you to buy 20 items from a certain list of participating items. I hit the 'fence' after I selected 20 items. I would have added more but wasn't sure if that meant I had to buy another 20 items to get the deal. Since I only wanted 3 or 4 more items not another 20 I stopped at 20. The business failed to communicate and in effect fenced me off from purchasing more items.</p>\\n<p>Websites have fences as well. It is very easy to make navigation so difficult that some of your content is effectively fenced off from the rest of the website. I frequently feel that way when I browse a site.

Rails scales, but requires servers.</p>\\n<p>merb is stripped down to the bare minimum.</p>\\n<h3>merb-core</h3>\\nUsed to use mongrel only but they added 'Rack Webserver Abstraction Layer' which makes the framework compatible with Ebb, Evented Mongrel, FastCGI, Mongrel, Thin, Webrick.\\n<p>merb app by default looks like this in config/rack.rb</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nrun Merb::Rack::Application.new\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>but because merb uses rack you can add code to intercept the request:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nclass ApiHandler\\n  def inialize(app)\\n     @app = app\\n  end\\n\\n  def call(env)\\n    request = Merb::Request.new(env)\\n    if request.path =~ %r{/api/(.*)}\\n       [200, {\\\"Content-Type\\\" => \\\"text/json\\\"}, Api.get_json($1)]\\n    else\\n       @app.call(env)\\n    end\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nuse ApiHandler\\nrun Merb::Rack::Application.new\\n\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>This code prevents a call into the framework making it very fast.</p>\\n<p>merb does routing like Rails, but also implements a powerful routing system that let's you use regular expressions.</p>\\n<p>Provides API</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\nMerb.add_mime_type(:yaml, :to_yml, %w[application/x-yaml text/yaml])\\nMerb.add_mime_type(:html, :to_html, %w[text/html application/xhtml+xml application/html])\\n\\nclass Posts < Application\\n  provides :json, :yaml, :xml\\n\\n  def show(id)\\n    @post = Post.find id\\n    display @post # depending on which content type was requested post will be rendered as html, yml, etc\\n  end\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<h3>Merb More</h3>\\nCan be added in one piece at a time.\\nCode Generators\\nAsset Bundling\\nMailers and Parts - mailers act like controllers so you can use filters and layouts\\nHaml and other templating support - when the merb server starts up it parses all the templates and turns them into ruby calls which make rendering much faster.\\nAction Args\\nCaching\\nOther essentials\\n<h3>merb Plugins</h3>\\nmerb_datamapper - his preference\\nmerb_activerecord - you can configure your merb app to use your rails app's model directory so that you can reuse a Rails app\\nmerb_sequel\\n<h3>Resources:</h3>\\nhttp://merbivore.com/\\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/merb?lnk=srg\\nhttp://merb.lighthouseapp.com/dashboard\\nhttp://github.com/wycats/merb-core/tree/master\\nhttp://git.or.cz/\\nhttp://ruby-prof.rubyforge.org/ - for profiling\\n<p>Ezra Zygmuntowicz's blog\\n<a href=\\\"http://brainspl.at/\\\">http://brainspl.at/</a></p>\\n<p>They are working on documentation and a book.
