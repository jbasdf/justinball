(funded by Cisco).\nWhat I actually do bores most people and causes my wife to roll her eyes and tune out anytime someone asks what I do.\nIt\'s a long story and involves a lot of technical crap that few people like to hear.</p>\n<p>For tonight I have a shorter explanation. You can see what I do. We are just polished up our latest\nrelease of the <a href="http://connect.teacherswithoutborders.org">new Teachers Without Borders website</a>.</p>\n<p>Teachers Without Borders is a global non-governmental organization (NGO) that helps build and mentor teacher leaders around the world.\nThe point of what we are building is to provide a place where those individuals can come together and interact and build up one another.\nWe are still in the early stages, so expect a great deal more from the project.</p>\n<p>The code that powers our social network is written in Ruby on Rails and is open source and MIT licensed. You can get it here:</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/jbasdf/luvfoo">https://github.com/jbasdf/luvfoo</a></p>\n<p>The name is a play off of the original project lovd-by-less that we forked. Thanks to all those that have contributed to that\nproject and made our life easier.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Teachers Without Borders",date:"September 03, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/teachers-without-borders"}}}});
