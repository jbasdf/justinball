Peer pressure keeps getting me even though I am now 32. I am starting to think I am lucky however. <a href="http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9738300-7.html">Some people are still waiting for their phones to go active</a>.</p>\n<p>Ouch.</p>\n<p>I came home. Updated iTunes (that took a few minutes longer than I expected. I imagine their servers were getting hit hard). Then I plugged in the phone. I got a few errors at first but after about 15 minutes the phone was up running and bringing me all kinds of sexy data. I can surf the web. I can check email. I feel like my life is changed. Ya, I know you could do that on the Blackberry a long time ago, but to that I say, have you seen the sexy iPod interface for browsing music. I just like to thumb back and forth through my albums because it is so dang addicting.</p>\n<p>My biggest complaint.</p>\n<p>I used to just toss my other phone around. It was free. No big deal if I dropped it a few times. With the iPhone every second it must be treated with utmost respect and caution.</p>\n<p>Damn Steve Jobs for that.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"iPhone Active",date:"June 30, 2007",image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/iphone-active"}}}});
