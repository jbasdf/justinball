After <a href="http://www.justinball.com/2008/09/08/why-cyclists-shave-their-legs-the-most-disgusting-post-i-will-ever-make/">last years run in with a rattle snake</a> I told myself and my wife that I wouldn\'t ride up there alone. My first ride, I couldn\'t find anyone to go with. How smart am I?</p>\n<p>I did take a camera and stopped to take a picture of where I got to hang out on the asphalt after trashing my knee last year:</p>\n <img src="img_9765.jpg" class="scale-image" alt="Black Smith Fork Canyon" />\n<p>Most inquiring minds and dedicated fans who diligently follow me in the sport of cycling will want to know how the ride went. I don\'t want to disappoint so I will lie and say it was great.</p>\n<p>It was fun, but 2 months with your leg in a brace and another 4 months with holidays whose sole meaning is to bring joy to the world via junk food really ruins your body. I made it to the top and by a miracle from heaven I even made it home but I don\'t feel so good right now so I\'m going to go lay down.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"First ride up Black Smith Fork canyon this season",date:"April 18, 2009",image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/img_9765-9feb1c5285991656b7a3d89babd6eb13-381d6.jpg"}}}}}},pathContext:{path:"/first-ride-up-black-smith-fork-canyon-this-season"}}}});
