I think I have come to the wrong session. He started by talking about how much power a server takes and how much bandwidth you may or may not need. I was hoping to see how to build a better, scalable Rails application. We aren't getting that and everything he is saying I know after running my own servers for years.</p>\n<p>I am thinking now that I will try to change rooms. This guy likes to blabber on about 'what is scalable' on and on. This is to a room of programmers that already knows what it is to scale. They want to know how to scale. Don't waste our time.</p>\n<p>The talk started to get better. He started showing real numbers and explain real ideas. However, I still left and headed over to Test Driven Development. I thought I might be behind but he has been going over basic stuff so I should still be good.</p>\n<p>So I wandered around to the Test Driven Development and the Scriptaculous sessions. They were a little to beginner so I am back in the scalability session.</p>\n<p>It has gotten good. He is providing real data.\nThey use Big IP load balancers because they are the only ones that can provide the throughput they want.\nThe bottle neck in a rails app is not rails it is the load balancer.\nThey divided up their app into app servers. One app does email, one does rss, one does calendar etc. They use layer 7 (Big IP) load balancers to divide up the traffic to the app servers. It looks like one app, but the requests go to different servers.\nVarnish is the best open source Load Balancer\nNginx for static content serving on Solaris\nThey get away from using a relational DB - what data can be moved out. In many cases you don't need a RDMS.\nMemcache\nLDAP - use this a lot. Using Sun Directory Server (open source)\n<a href=\"http://www.process-one.net/en/jeai/\">J-EAI</a> (message bus with an in memory db) use this to manage db reads and writes. You can program the bus and tell it to read and write at given intervals. Written in erlang. You can put all your data into the base. This includes email, atom, rss etc. It scales. It connects to all kinds of apps. They are going to release to the world.\nFile system - put some stuff on the file system. Never more than 10k files/subdirs in a single directory - aim for 4k max\nDon't nest to deeply.\nPre-create 16 top level directories, 256 subdirs each which gives you 4096 buckets.</p>\n<p>federate via DNS. Scale it out by sending requests for each subdomain to different servers. They use power DNS.</p>\n<p>I didn't care much for the intro, but the second half of this talk was amazing and Jason is a great guy. I think that besides the technical points I learned that you shouldn't spend to much time on your intro or might lose the audience.

Black is going over some of the background of rest including ideas from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Roy Thomas Fielding\'s dissertation</a> which is generally attributed as the beginning of REST.  He said that he would focus on the more practical aspects of REST in Rails, but he can\'t resist talking about some theory.  I am ok with that, but I have read it before.  Hopefully he will get to the details of REST and routing in Rails and delve into some of the more advanced scenarios which is where we are typically having problems.</p>\n<p>We have started into REST in Rails.  It is interesting that Black needs to caveat his comments due to changes coming in Edge Rails.  The \';\' is being replaced with a \'/\'.  We are talking about why controllers are plural (your REST operations are performed on a collection.)  Again, not new stuff.  I am hoping to see nested routes or stuff like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="ruby">\n map.resources :users, :has_many => [:services, :websites], :collection => { :complete => :get, :confirm => :get, :confirm => :post }\n</pre></code>\n<p>or this</p>\n<pre><code class="ruby">\nmap.resources :users do |users|\n  users.resources :services\nend\n</pre></code>\n<p>and why one might be better than another.  <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources">Jamis Buck wrote that he doesn\'t nescessarily like the nested routes</a>.

Then click on the tag filter tab. Not a lot there yet, but for example if you click on "Lego" you will find at least one geeky guy that likes Legos. That tag is based on things that I have Ozmozed and on tags that come in through my blog. This is still a bit buggy. We\'ll get it fixed.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="2">\n<li>\n<p>Join groups and save your friends from needless IM and email spam.\nWe all find something we just have to share. Do you friends a favor. Ozmozr instead of IMing it. When you Ozmoze a page it can go to a group or to friends and they can view it when they feel like it. At some point (soon I hope) we\'ll let you send the page to your del.icio.us account when you Ozmoze it so you don\'t have to do both.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tag based news filtering.\nWe still are getting this to work, but at some point in the near future you will be able to add a feed to a group and specify that only posts tagged with certain tags make it into the group. This is to support my own problem. I post all kinds of stuff to my personal blog. I don\'t want 90% of it say the Ruby on Rails group. So I subscribe the Ruby on Rails group to the Justinball.com blog and specify that only posts containing ruby make it to the group. Same with say a delicious or flickr feed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>News aggregator. We can\'t compete with the big news readers like bloglines and Google reader, but we do have a simple reader that lets you browse the feeds you have collected via the tags that those feeds are outputting. I don\'t know that anyone else is doing that just yet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Microformats. Add your blog and then put something into a post that contains a date marked up with the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hcalendar microformat</a>. You\'ll find that it shows up in your list of events. We also parse the html from any page that is ozmozed. Microformats are very cool. We will be adding an ical parser sometime soon as well. So, eventually you will be able to subscribe to your buddy\'s blog. He makes a post and puts in an event. Ozmozr parses that. You then use your Google calendar to subscribe to the ical that Ozmozr outputs. Viola, the post your buddy made magically shows up on your Google calendar.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I\'ll add more on monday, but for now hopefully these features help clarify a part of Ozmozr\'s purpose.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-01-20-ozmozr-is-out-there/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/ozmozr-is-out-there",date:"2007-01-20T07:00:00Z",title:"ozmozr is out there",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"So my wife bought my daughters some simple math books.

Over the past five years I have been formulating my primary theory regarding the fundamental nature of computers.</p>\n<p>I post it to the world now because my Mac crashed yesterday.</p>\n<p>Here it is:\nThere are millions of very intelligent educated people in this world who know how to do very complicated things like design bridges and fix cars and build big buildings and so on. You and I know these people. Some of them are old - old used to be 30 but I am 30 now so from now on I define old as older than me. Some of them are young. They all have one thing in common. They own a computer and shouldn't. These are the guys that annoy you when they get a new printer and ask you to come install it. However, those of us who know how to use computers should be very glad that they have computers and try to use them. This is why....</p>\n<p>As per my education, my theory of computers is thus:\nIf the person is not smarter than the computer the computer will pull the knowledge from the person sitting in front of it. This energy is how computers work. They share it with other computers around the world via the internet. This is true. I swear it is. It is the secret that all computer science and electrical engineer people know and have thus far kept from the world. It is a grand conspiracy and now I break the silence and reveal it unto you.</p>\n<p>Now back to my Mac crashing. I know why it did and it was about due. It hasn't crashed for a very long time because it has had plenty of energy to use that it pulled from all of the inexperienced people sitting in front of their computers around the world. For a few moments, at that instance in time, somewhere in the world and old guy figured out how to plug in his usb camera, or how to use Word or something. I am not sure what exactly, but for that brief moment he sucked back some of the energy thus causing my Mac to crash.</p>\n<p>I'm not to worried.

Part of that process is changing names and coming up with new terms and definitions. However, such actions make it difficult for those of us who are not part of the 'in crowd.' We are the users that don't know about these conferences(by serendipity we met Phil Windley just a few months ago), but who are still in charge of implementing these solutions. Finding out about the different solutions using a Google search can become confusing and tedious. Every new term that is added only adds to that pain. Wide adoption demands simplicity. As any given solution becomes more diverse/complicated/scattered/hard to document/longer adoption of that solution will decrease. I think the inverse is also true. If the solution is well documented, is simple to implement(even if it has complex additional functionality the initial implementation for any given user should be simple) has examples in many languages for many platforms and presents a unified front to the world its adoption will increase.\nDevelopers often talk about building solutions that are simple for end users. The result of this action is greater use of the product. The same principle applies to code. Make it easy for other developers and more people will use your stuff.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2006-12-05-newbs-impressions-of-digital-identity/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/newbs-impressions-of-digital-identity",date:"2006-12-05T07:00:00Z",title:"Newbs Impressions of Digital Identity",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Just short of a year ago I hacked together a project that we loving called  scrumdidilyumptio.us .

XDI is the interface that Le Leche uses to access the Kintera systems. It lets a machine make requests to a remote system kind of like SQL lets an app query a database. Kind of interesting, and useful for large enterprise systems. The example being shown requires that the two parties know each other and setup a complex contract before interactions are allowed to occur.

I even had a Dr tell me that if I wasn\'t cycling he would recommend few carbs for weight loss. However, I have a buddy who is a nutritionist. We talked about diets like South Beach and Atkins a long time ago. His opinion, they will kill you. The human body wasn\'t designed to eat just protien and fat and in fact we are built for carbs. Apparently, Protien rich low carb diets were tried in the 1970s but the trials ended because people became depressed and irritable. So I am<a href="http://www.lcmedia.com/mind453.htm"> listening to NPR this morning and Richard Wurtman, MD and Judith Wurtman PhD from MIT on the show</a>. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/crc/www/">Here is a link to their research center.</a> They have been looking at the link between seratonin and mood. Seratonin or the lack of can make you mad, irratible, depressed etc. It is produced by the brain when you eat carbs. The carbs make your body release insulin which in turn produces <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan">tryptophan</a>. Tryptophan results in seratonin production in the brain. Thus, many carbohydrate rich foods are called comfort foods because they do in fact put you in a better mood.</p>\n<p>I am not a Dr nor do I know much about the human brain, but if you diet it would be worth looking at the science that comes from REAL Doctors, not the ones paid to put thier picture on the book, and make sure that the choices you are making are healthy.</p>\n<p>As for me I will be getting my butt back on the bike.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2006-11-16-diet/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/diet",date:"2006-11-16T07:00:00Z",title:"Diet",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}}],pathPrefix:"archive",first:!1,last:!1,index:28,pageCount:33}}}});
