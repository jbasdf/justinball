Of course this wasn’t sufficient to prevent the impending separation – only lights on the top eves of the house would be a sufficient sacrifice to stave off a divorce lawyer.</p>\\n<p>At great peril, a very kind neighbor and I attempted the feat. As each roof clip drew us closer to the two story eves and we had to climb higher on the roof it became clear that we would have to abort the attempt or die.</p>\\n<p>I don’t like death so we quit.</p>\\n<p>My wife didn’t really like our style of ‘safe’ decorating where the only lights were the ones we could reach so I called someone – a “professional.” I figured that a bunch of guys with safety harnesses and ladders certified by OSA would show up wearing helmets and other such gear.</p>\\n<p>Two guys showed up with a ladder, climbed up on my roof and scaled the eves learning perilously over the edge clipping Christmas lights to the shingles. They did the exact same thing we failed at. It was just as dangerous. It just wasn’t as dangerous for my buddy or me.</p>\\n<p>Now you might assume the moral of this event is that I am a wuss, but you would be wrong. That’s not the point at all so if that’s what you are thinking then you can just stick it where the sun don’t shine.</p>\\n<p>The point is that the title ‘professional’ is frequently bestowed upon an individual based on the fact that they are being paid for the task not based on how well equipped or trained they are. The two guys that came to my house were no safer than my friend and I, nor did they have any technique or skill that we lacked but they were ‘professionals.’</p>\\n<p>I write software for a living. Many businesses want ‘enterprise’ software a label bestowed as lightly as ‘professional’. The label helps the investors sleep at night or something but it doesn’t really help get the job done. However, that label builds trust and keeps the dollars rolling.</p>\\n<p>So what makes something ‘enterprise’ worthy?</p>\\n<p>Professionals build enterprise software.\\nThis means a poor schmuck is paid to sit in a cubicle at a large boring company where he cranks out a few lines of code per day while wondering if he’ll make it through the next layoffs. He is the guy hanging from the edge of the roof clipping Christmas lights.</p>\\n<p>Big companies build enterprise software.\\nMicrosoft is a big company. IBM is a big company. SAP is a big company. Sun is a big company. You really have to have a lot of people working for you whose job is to tell the guy hanging the Christmas lights that he is too close to the edge, that he ladder should be moved a few inches to the left, that they need a process in place for decided which lights go where and that before they hang any lights they really should have a committee get together and analyze the situation.</p>\\n<p>Enterprise software takes a long time to build.\\nMicrosoft proves this with each release taking approximately three years. I live dangerously so I run edge Rails. In any given day there are multiple updates. You have to be careful about writing tests but at the end of the day I get the same code that the guys at 37signals gets and I don’t have to sign anything that says I am a big boy and so I can run software that hasn’t been stamped with an official release. See above where you have a committee to analyze the lights and you will know why it takes a long time to build enterprise software.</p>\\n<p>Enterprise software is well tested.\\nCode is then passed to a ‘professional’ QA department consisting of individuals still hung over from the weekend and the latest meeting where the manager made sure to use the words ‘agile’, ‘process’, and enterprise-worthy at least 20 times each. I guess my Christmas light hanging buddies could implement this. They would model my house in a wind tunnel then hang lights using various clips and methods. After that they would come to my house with big fans to make sure the wind didn’t take down my lights. They could setup a test model home etc etc.</p>\\n<p>Enterprise software is well marketed.\\nThis is true. Through millions of dollars of advertising and smoozing the label of ‘enterprise’ is bestowed. It costs a lot of money for rounds of golf and booze for the marketing guys. Note that this process takes several years during which time smaller non-enterprise teams have evolved with the market and now offer something Ruby on Rails that actually meets the needs of developers.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-01-30-professionals-and-the-enterprise/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/professionals-and-the-enterprise\",\"date\":\"2008-01-30T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Professionals and The Enterprise\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"President Hinckley passed away sunday night.

A few years ago my dad told me that it is the only Walmart that has a fishing pro shop. I was never a fisherman but there are some world class fishing areas around that area and so a local small business market was created for mom and pop style pro fishing shops. These local shops could offer plenty of advice about where to fish and what kind of bait/flys to use. Walmart not content to rule the great consumer world figured they could take out a few more local shops by establishing a cut rate, made in China pro shop that could never offer the service or expertise of the smaller guys but which would gradually edge out the guys who built the market in the first place. Consumers love cheap and fast, but don't always realize what they are giving up.</p>\\n<p>Today I learned that <a href=\\\"http://www.seochat.com/c/a/Search-Engine-News/WalMart-Offers-SEO-and-SEM-Services/\\\">Walmart and Sams have entered the SEO market</a>. This seems absurd and if you pay attention to what they are offering you will realize it is ridiculous. In typical Walmart fashion they are charging a low price, but what you are getting is junk. For $25 a month they will submit your site to search engines - a practice that has been long abandoned. For $50 they will help you setup a campaign using Google or Yahoo. Just like the pro shops instance, Walmart saw a market and is now attempting to take it over from those who built it - the SEO professionals who have been at this for 10 years.</p>\\n<p>Will they succeed? I am betting they will have an impact. There are plenty of small businesses that don't understand technology and who shop at Sams. For $25 or even $50 a month wouldn't you love to have your internet marketing problems go away.</p>\\n<p>In the end they will get the kind of service you get at Walmart which is almost always sub par. The irony here is that SEO is a service not a commodity, but they are packaging it as a commodity and those who bite will be disappointed in the results. The upside to this is that the SEO market has little to worry about. The guys who will only pay $25 don't make great clients and those who care about internet marketing will continue to do SEO the hard way which is the only way to be successful in that space.</p>\\n<p>Giant companies like Walmart are great at efficiency so for the every day stuff they do a great job. If I need shampoo or diapers I am buying from a large manufacturer so I don't really care if I buy it at Walmart or some other similar store. The lowest price in that instance wins.</p>\\n<p>Giant companies are not good at customer service, local knowledge and information dissemination. If you are headed out for the ultimate fishing trip do you want to get your information from some kid making $6/hr or a guy that has fished every river for 100 miles. If you want gardening information do you really want to ask the 16 year old in the funny uniform or do you want to go to the garden store that charges a bit more, but who can tell you exactly what is wrong with your tree by looking at a few leaves? (I go to <a href=\\\"http://www.cachechamber.com/chamber_data/members/businessdetail.php?recordID=2443\\\">Anderson Seed in Logan</a>. They are awesome).</p>\\n<p>If you want SEO would you ever trust the company who is currently coming up with a strategy to put you out of business?

All the images are generated on the fly from a set of core images. There are a couple of things that I find amazing and very convenient about this. The amazing part is that the image processing is very fast. After the first image generation the file is cached so that helps and if I need to regenerate all the images on the site I only need to delete the image cache folder. The convenient part is that we are able to generate images of all sizes, and quality and we can vary background colors if we are doing an image fit. That way if we don't like what the images look like I can tweak a few settings and the change is reflected across all the images which number somewhere in the 500,000 range.</p>\\n<p>Pretty cool.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-01-23-a-late-night-updating-house-plans-on-theplancollectioncom/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/a-late-night-updating-house-plans-on-theplancollectioncom\",\"date\":\"2008-01-23T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"A Gazillion House Plans on ThePlanCollection.com\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I created a code generator that writes all the of the code that connects  ThePlanCollection.com  website with its database.

Of course this wasn’t sufficient to prevent the impending separation – only lights on the top eves of the house would be a sufficient sacrifice to stave off a divorce lawyer.</p>\\n<p>At great peril, a very kind neighbor and I attempted the feat. As each roof clip drew us closer to the two story eves and we had to climb higher on the roof it became clear that we would have to abort the attempt or die.</p>\\n<p>I don’t like death so we quit.</p>\\n<p>My wife didn’t really like our style of ‘safe’ decorating where the only lights were the ones we could reach so I called someone – a “professional.” I figured that a bunch of guys with safety harnesses and ladders certified by OSA would show up wearing helmets and other such gear.</p>\\n<p>Two guys showed up with a ladder, climbed up on my roof and scaled the eves learning perilously over the edge clipping Christmas lights to the shingles. They did the exact same thing we failed at. It was just as dangerous. It just wasn’t as dangerous for my buddy or me.</p>\\n<p>Now you might assume the moral of this event is that I am a wuss, but you would be wrong. That’s not the point at all so if that’s what you are thinking then you can just stick it where the sun don’t shine.</p>\\n<p>The point is that the title ‘professional’ is frequently bestowed upon an individual based on the fact that they are being paid for the task not based on how well equipped or trained they are. The two guys that came to my house were no safer than my friend and I, nor did they have any technique or skill that we lacked but they were ‘professionals.’</p>\\n<p>I write software for a living. Many businesses want ‘enterprise’ software a label bestowed as lightly as ‘professional’. The label helps the investors sleep at night or something but it doesn’t really help get the job done. However, that label builds trust and keeps the dollars rolling.</p>\\n<p>So what makes something ‘enterprise’ worthy?</p>\\n<p>Professionals build enterprise software.\\nThis means a poor schmuck is paid to sit in a cubicle at a large boring company where he cranks out a few lines of code per day while wondering if he’ll make it through the next layoffs. He is the guy hanging from the edge of the roof clipping Christmas lights.</p>\\n<p>Big companies build enterprise software.\\nMicrosoft is a big company. IBM is a big company. SAP is a big company. Sun is a big company. You really have to have a lot of people working for you whose job is to tell the guy hanging the Christmas lights that he is too close to the edge, that he ladder should be moved a few inches to the left, that they need a process in place for decided which lights go where and that before they hang any lights they really should have a committee get together and analyze the situation.</p>\\n<p>Enterprise software takes a long time to build.\\nMicrosoft proves this with each release taking approximately three years. I live dangerously so I run edge Rails. In any given day there are multiple updates. You have to be careful about writing tests but at the end of the day I get the same code that the guys at 37signals gets and I don’t have to sign anything that says I am a big boy and so I can run software that hasn’t been stamped with an official release. See above where you have a committee to analyze the lights and you will know why it takes a long time to build enterprise software.</p>\\n<p>Enterprise software is well tested.\\nCode is then passed to a ‘professional’ QA department consisting of individuals still hung over from the weekend and the latest meeting where the manager made sure to use the words ‘agile’, ‘process’, and enterprise-worthy at least 20 times each. I guess my Christmas light hanging buddies could implement this. They would model my house in a wind tunnel then hang lights using various clips and methods. After that they would come to my house with big fans to make sure the wind didn’t take down my lights. They could setup a test model home etc etc.</p>\\n<p>Enterprise software is well marketed.\\nThis is true. Through millions of dollars of advertising and smoozing the label of ‘enterprise’ is bestowed. It costs a lot of money for rounds of golf and booze for the marketing guys. Note that this process takes several years during which time smaller non-enterprise teams have evolved with the market and now offer something Ruby on Rails that actually meets the needs of developers.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-01-30-professionals-and-the-enterprise/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/professionals-and-the-enterprise\",\"date\":\"2008-01-30T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Professionals and The Enterprise\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"President Hinckley passed away sunday night.

A few years ago my dad told me that it is the only Walmart that has a fishing pro shop. I was never a fisherman but there are some world class fishing areas around that area and so a local small business market was created for mom and pop style pro fishing shops. These local shops could offer plenty of advice about where to fish and what kind of bait/flys to use. Walmart not content to rule the great consumer world figured they could take out a few more local shops by establishing a cut rate, made in China pro shop that could never offer the service or expertise of the smaller guys but which would gradually edge out the guys who built the market in the first place. Consumers love cheap and fast, but don't always realize what they are giving up.</p>\\n<p>Today I learned that <a href=\\\"http://www.seochat.com/c/a/Search-Engine-News/WalMart-Offers-SEO-and-SEM-Services/\\\">Walmart and Sams have entered the SEO market</a>. This seems absurd and if you pay attention to what they are offering you will realize it is ridiculous. In typical Walmart fashion they are charging a low price, but what you are getting is junk. For $25 a month they will submit your site to search engines - a practice that has been long abandoned. For $50 they will help you setup a campaign using Google or Yahoo. Just like the pro shops instance, Walmart saw a market and is now attempting to take it over from those who built it - the SEO professionals who have been at this for 10 years.</p>\\n<p>Will they succeed? I am betting they will have an impact. There are plenty of small businesses that don't understand technology and who shop at Sams. For $25 or even $50 a month wouldn't you love to have your internet marketing problems go away.</p>\\n<p>In the end they will get the kind of service you get at Walmart which is almost always sub par. The irony here is that SEO is a service not a commodity, but they are packaging it as a commodity and those who bite will be disappointed in the results. The upside to this is that the SEO market has little to worry about. The guys who will only pay $25 don't make great clients and those who care about internet marketing will continue to do SEO the hard way which is the only way to be successful in that space.</p>\\n<p>Giant companies like Walmart are great at efficiency so for the every day stuff they do a great job. If I need shampoo or diapers I am buying from a large manufacturer so I don't really care if I buy it at Walmart or some other similar store. The lowest price in that instance wins.</p>\\n<p>Giant companies are not good at customer service, local knowledge and information dissemination. If you are headed out for the ultimate fishing trip do you want to get your information from some kid making $6/hr or a guy that has fished every river for 100 miles. If you want gardening information do you really want to ask the 16 year old in the funny uniform or do you want to go to the garden store that charges a bit more, but who can tell you exactly what is wrong with your tree by looking at a few leaves? (I go to <a href=\\\"http://www.cachechamber.com/chamber_data/members/businessdetail.php?recordID=2443\\\">Anderson Seed in Logan</a>. They are awesome).</p>\\n<p>If you want SEO would you ever trust the company who is currently coming up with a strategy to put you out of business?

Take a look and let me know what you think.</p>\\n<p>One of the most interesting parts of building out these new part of the system is the updates I have made to the image processing code. All the images are generated on the fly from a set of core images. There are a couple of things that I find amazing and very convenient about this. The amazing part is that the image processing is very fast. After the first image generation the file is cached so that helps and if I need to regenerate all the images on the site I only need to delete the image cache folder. The convenient part is that we are able to generate images of all sizes, and quality and we can vary background colors if we are doing an image fit. That way if we don't like what the images look like I can tweak a few settings and the change is reflected across all the images which number somewhere in the 500,000 range.</p>\\n<p>Pretty cool.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-01-23-a-late-night-updating-house-plans-on-theplancollectioncom/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/a-late-night-updating-house-plans-on-theplancollectioncom\",\"date\":\"2008-01-23T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"A Gazillion House Plans on ThePlanCollection.com\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I created a code generator that writes all the of the code that connects  ThePlanCollection.com  website with its database.

So in my code I have to create a member variable that indicates the value is supposed to be null so that it can be passed to the database as null.

I should have caught this bug. I should have known not to change a default value a week ago. However, ultimately I blame this on the !@#$ morons at M$.
