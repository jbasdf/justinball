Some people like it others hate it. There seem to be plenty of people that don\'t like Trek just because they are a big company. Personally, I like them because they are a US company, make good bikes, and have a good warranty. Aside from smaller builders - <a href="">Calfee</a>, <a href="">Crumpton</a>, and <a href="">Parlee</a>, Trek is the only company that builds their own bikes right here in the US. I don\'t know where Trek gets their carbon. I would like to know that. <a href="">Time actually makes their carbon from the fiber</a> (click on company and then Time Visit on the left hand side. Their site nav kinda sucks.</p>\n<p> [1]: <a href="http://forums.roadbikereview.com/showthread.php?t=97036&#x26;highlight=2008">http://forums.roadbikereview.com/showthread.php?t=97036&#x26;highlight=2008</a> madone\n[2]: <a href="http://www.calfeedesign.com/">http://www.calfeedesign.com/</a>\n[3]: <a href="http://www.crumptoncycles.com/">http://www.crumptoncycles.com/</a>\n[4]: <a href="http://www.parleecycles.com/">http://www.parleecycles.com/</a>\n[5]: <a href="http://www.time-sport.com/us/home.htm">http://www.time-sport.com/us/home.htm</a></p>\n<p>Anyway, I will keep finding stuff on the new Madone and post it until you all want to puke.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"2008 Madone Seatpost, and Trek love/hate",date:"June 11, 2007",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/2008-madone-seatpost-and-trek-lovehate"}}}});
