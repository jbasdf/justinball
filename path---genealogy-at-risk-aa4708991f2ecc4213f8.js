For decades the LDS church has been microfilming every record possible\nand preserving those records in a secured granite vault in the mountains outside of Salt Lake City. This effort helps to ensure those records are preserved for future generations.\nAs technology has advanced many of those records have become available online. All of the records have always been available to anyone, LDS or not, so that they could research their ancestry.</p>\n<p>There are religious differences at the heart of this move, but it seems like those differences could be worked out. <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/">FamilySearch.org</a> has been a great resource for many years\nnow and is enjoyed by anyone with access to the Internet. In more recent years companies like <a href="http://www.geni.com">Geni.com</a> and <a href="http://www.myfamily.com">MyFamily.com</a> have shown that genealogy is not the boring realm\nof old people with nothing better to do, but an engaging activity enjoyed by family members young and old. The preservation of the lineage of mankind and access to that precious\ninformation seem like such worthwhile endeavours that surely both parties can reach an accord.</p>\n<p>If not then we have just witnessed a genealogical nuclear bomb.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Genealogy at Risk?",date:"May 04, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/genealogy-at-risk"}}}});
