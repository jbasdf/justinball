Years ago I read about mountain biking in Hawaii and how awesome it was. It is awesome, but I don\'t remember reading about getting an ass kicking in the article. Oahu is beautiful and the mountain biking was a fun challenge, but tree roots and mud make up a lot of the trail. If you venture into the rain forest here be ready for plenty of both. I tried the <a href="http://www.mtbhawaii.com/trails/west_kaunala_trail">West Kaunala Trail</a>. I\'m not a hard core mountain biker so I found this ride a fun challenge with plenty of hike a bike sections over tree roots and through some nasty mud. A more skilled rider could probably ride more. I\'d love to watch someone with skills climb the sections with nasty roots.</p>\n<p>Some pictures:</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_14821.jpg" />\n<p>There\'s a very idyllic ranch on the way up.</p>\n<p>The jeep road is wide and makes for an easy/fun ride</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1506.jpg" />\n<p>I think I rode the route opposite of what was recommended. Here\'s where I started.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1508.jpg" />\n<p>Plenty of muck and mud to plow through.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1514.jpg" />\n<p>More mud. It was a theme.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1525.jpg" />\n<p>This was cool. Nice of the trees to not block the trail.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1517.jpg" />\n<p>There are 4 creek crossings.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1522.jpg" />\n<p>This is where the killer trees on Lord of the Rings came from.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1528.jpg" />\n<p>The view is the reward for the climb. That\'s the North Shore of Oahu.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1496.jpg" />\n<p>After mountain biking I managed to get in a bit of a road ride back to Turtle Bay to meet everyone else. The roads on Oahu aren\'t my favorite places to ride. There\'s a constant stream of traffic and I moved off the road a couple of times. The saving grace was the fruit stands along the side of the road. The nice old lady who sold me pineapple and papaya laughed pretty hard when I tried to stuff everything into my tiny Camelback. I nearly dropped the pineapple so I ended up carrying all the groceries on the handlebars - XTR/Sram 29er turned into grocery hauler.</p>\n<p>We ended the night helping Judy make it home from Haleiwa Joes:</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1577.jpg" />\n<p>Actually we ended the night this way:</p>\n<p>The only thing scarier than a mouse is a cockroach.</p>\n <img class="scale-image" src="IMG_1582.jpg" />',frontmatter:{title:"Mountain Biking Oahu",date:"January 14, 2013",image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/IMG_14821-dc7e6341b0bea5bfc3fdbca14bf4b1c9-381d6.jpg"}}}}}},pathContext:{path:"/mountain-biking-oahu"}}}});
