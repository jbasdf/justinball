He was 97. It isn\'t possible to say enough good about a man whose example to all was unity, peace, and to "do a little better" and "stand a little taller". Whether you are LDS or not those values are universal and something anyone can live by. He will be missed greatly.</p>\n<p>President Hinckley is really the first prophet to be around for the era of blogs and so is probably the first prophet to be mourned via the general internet, blog sphere and even on Facebook.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the internet is that it connects us in ways never before possible. Everyday individuals are now able to express ideas, thoughts and grief along side the public outlets in a way that sends their message to large numbers of individuals.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"A Modern Prophet",date:"January 29, 2008",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
