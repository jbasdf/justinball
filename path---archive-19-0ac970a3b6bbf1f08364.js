The 5.5 felt smooth and responsive. It was lite but not skittish like the Roubiax. The last bike I rode was a Madone 6.5. It felt slightly lighter than the 5.5, but what surprised me was that the ride quality was a bit better. Given that both bikes have a similar geometry I expected the ride quality to be equal or for the 6.5 to have a slightly harsher feel do to the higher modulus carbon. The opposite was true and the 'Red' carbon on the 6.5 seem to be just a bit smoother than the 'Black' carbon on the 5.5. Of course the difference could also be attributed to the wheels. It is hard to say, but the overall package on the 6.5 offered a slightly sweeter ride.</p>\n<p>There are currently a couple of 6.9 Madones available. I could have one here in a week.

This year Utah citizens have the option of either a <a href=\"http://www.senatesite.com/blog/2007/12/conservative-marries-progressive.html\">flat tax rate of 5.35</a>% or the standard 7% rate with deductions. The population of Utah is made up of a large number of members of the LDS church who pay a 'flat' 10% of their income as tithing. Therefore, I am sure that the 5.35% seems very appealing - even divine given its similarity to the tithing structure. However, I would be very interested in the overall effect of this tax on the general population. In my personal case the flat tax would have resulted in an increase of more than $1,000. Even though 5.35% is a smaller number than 7% the net result is a greater portion of my income going to the state. I don't think that my situation is much different than many Utahns so I wonder if others would also be adversely affected. Given that the country is moving towards recession now is not the time to increase taxes. I think that the intent of the flat tax is not only to simplify the tax structure, but also to reduce the tax burden. However, it fails on the later part. I think that the flat tax will disproportionally benefit the wealthy. Consider the constituency that benefits from tax deductions - families with children, home owners and those who tend to donate to charity (like churches). Those who are wealthy benefit from these deductions as well, but the deductions will constitute a smaller percent of their income forcing them to pay 7% on when the deductions stop helping. Under the flat tax their responsibility would drop to 5.35% on the greater part of their income.</p>\n<p>These are my guesses. I would be interested to see an actual study that could help outline who will benefit and who will be adversely affected by the new tax structure. Utahns will have the chance to chose their tax system in November.

Their conclusion was that the 5.2 was almost as good of a bike. It weighs 600 grams more. However, most of the weight savings comes from the expensive wheels which shave 290 grams. The new Ultegra SL looks cool, works great and is almost as light as Dura-ace. You can almost buy two 5.2s for the cost of a 6.9 which means that I could get one for myself and one for the wife.</p>\n<p>At any rate I think I might head to the local shop at lunch and find out what my riding habit is going to cost this summer.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-19-project-one-goes-live-with-the-new-madones/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/project-one-goes-live-with-the-new-madones",date:"2008-03-19T06:00:00Z",title:"Project One Goes Live With the New Madones",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Cycling","madone","project one","trek"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"I am frequently asked how reliable/scalable is Ruby on Rails?

If your website ranks high and you get plenty of traffic you can convert that into real dollars through ad revenue or sales of existing items. That model makes sense to most people. However, there are other instances where popularity turns into real dollars. Observe the number of individuals who have gained respect within a given community who then become high paid consultants.

Understanding the models behind it will surely lead to new and interesting opportunities for those that understand and embrace it.</p>",

(If you think you are paying $1500 to learn about how Rails routes work then its time to rethink your life.) iPhones may not be ubiquitous yet, but they are popular enough that some social networks have started targeting them specifically. When bluetooth was born free thinkers imagined a meetup system that everyone on the network would use. Just set your phone to 'meet me' and you would find yourself swamped with babes in no time. 8 years later the network never emerged. The prospect of opening yourself up to anyone on the street was a little much to bear even by the dandiest socialite. Like so many other things in life - generic development platforms, my education, etc - the idea lacked context. Context sells.</p>\n<p>Back to the iPhone. The phone has wifi. There is a sweet SDL available. Here goes. Build a rich 'intro to the virtual me' application. It can be as simple as I am Justin. I am a Ruby programmer. I would love to meet other Ruby programmers. Make it easy to store a number of profiles then when you attend a conference or social event set the profile most relevant to that setting public. Others in the wifi grid would see this along with the profiles of everyone else participating. Press the friend invite the other person gets a friend request - a virtual business card exchange. Add scheduling into the application so that ad-hoc meetups can be arranged. Throw in Twitter and blog integration so that you can follow what your new friends are saying and you have a powerful social exchange. The network can be formed anew for each event you attend and archived online to a social service. For the contacts you hit it off with you can become friends on Facebook, follow each other on Twitter, or add each other's blogs to your aggregator. Nerdy engineers rejoice. Now even the introduction can be virtual.

Ever since then the vast majority of the members have ignored this council and the overall level of guilt among the LDS faithful has continued to rise as each successive generation followed the example of the previous. Technology now provides some relief from the burden. Journal writing, a boring effort prompting statements like, \"I really should write in my journal but I need to clean the drains,\" has been replaced by the uber hip practice of blogging, Facebook profiles and lifestreams. If Brigham had only spun journal writing a little differently the church could have been oh so cool. An early prophesy encouraging rich Myspace profile development could have shaken the very foundations of cool society.\nAs our real lives become more and more intertwined with our virtual lives the amount of data being stored about our daily lives is beginning to fill millions of Gigabytes in the 'cloud'. Much of this data is collected or generated with little effort. Twitter makes it easy to keep a timeline of your life. WordPress, Typepad, or Blogspot make heavier entry creation simple. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"http://www.friendfeed.com\">FriendFeed</a> make sharing your life simple and del.cio.us keeps track of everything that's interesting to you.</p>\n<p>For genealogists or family historians the next step is to find a way to aggregate and then store all this information long term. This is harder than it sounds, but invaluable for personal history and online identity. The trick becomes controlling the data that becomes part of your 'permanent record'. While pictures of you downing jello shots with your buddies might be funny to you and your buddies now, unless you are my brother in law Brad you don't want that distributed in the family newsletter. Nor would you want your kids reading about that 20 years from now. 150 years from now however the information becomes historical, less incriminating and it could become a more interesting part of your identity. There is a historian in the small town where my dad grew up who kept track of simple histories of everyone buried in the local cemetery. When those people were alive they would not have loved for people to know that they were a horse thief, adulterer, gambler etc, but for some reason a couple of generations later that information becomes a colorful and interesting part of the family history. Being able to seal up your more personal deeds for 150 years could be an interesting option for a personal history aggregator/archiver.</p>\n<p>The monotonous task of personal history has given way to the popular methods of keeping a virtual life. While the term 'lifestream' sounds more fun than 'personal history' the two activities are not dissimilar and offer and opportunity for everyone to gather their history without much effort.
