I went to the command line to run the task and got 'SQL2005 or higher is required for sp_expressmaint'. Turns out there is a bug in the sp_expressmaint stored procedure that ships with SQL Server 2008 Express Edition. <a href=\"http://developers.de/blogs/senad_hajric/archive/2009/05/25/bug-sql-2008-express-edition-stored-procedure-sp-dbmaintenance.aspx\">The first result on Google provided the solution</a>. Luckily it's really easy to fix. Just open up the stored procedures on your master database (they're under 'programability'). Then find this line:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>IF (select SUBSTRING(@@version,(CHARINDEX('-',@@version) 2),1))</code></pre>\n      </div>",frontmatter:{title:"SQL2005 or higher is required for sp_expressmaint",date:"November 22, 2010",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/sql2005-or-higher-is-required-for-sp_expressmaint"}}}});
