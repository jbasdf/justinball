There is an interesting combination of people here and I must admit that I feel like a foreigner as I am part of an academic group. The current session I am in is titled “The Next Internet Infrastructure.” I expected something about servers and bandwidth which would have been interesting, but I am getting something much better. Marc Canter, CEO, Broadband Mechanics (peopleaggregator.com), Jeff Barr, Senior Evangelist, Amazon, Chad Dickerson, Yahoo!, and Jonathan Hare, Co-founder and CEO, Resilient are talking about identity and open APIs.
