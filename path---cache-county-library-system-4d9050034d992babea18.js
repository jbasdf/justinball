This is unfortunate as it creates a barrier to information for those who really need it. By combining resources the libraries will be able to provide a greater number of resources to everyone in the county. There is an initiative to form a county wide library system. <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/CACHELIB/petition.html">Sign the petition and provide access to all the materials for everyone</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Cache County Library System",date:"February 27, 2008",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/cache-county-library-system"}}}});
