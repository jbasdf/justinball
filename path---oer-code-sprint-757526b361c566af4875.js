This has been a great time feels quite a bit different than the higher level OER meetings I have attended. The first few hours of the first day were spent chatting, but after that I think that quite a bit of code has been hacked together. Normally I would oppose lots of travel decrying it as a waste of resources. However, this event has been productive. Put a bunch of smart people in a room who are capable of some kind of productive output and you will get productive output.</p>\n<p>Here are some pictures:\n<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2246396743_82426d119d.jpg?v=0" alt="OER Sprint">\n<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2338/2247192314_50ff6887e6.jpg?v=0" alt="OER Sprint at COSL">\n<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2082/2247194530_a248d867b5.jpg?v=0" alt="OER interoperability code sprint">\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caswell_tom/sets/72157603860939994/">Flickr Photo Set</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"OER Code Sprint",date:"February 06, 2008",image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/oer-code-sprint"}}}});
