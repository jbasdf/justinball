Mary Magdelene may not be buried under the upside down pyramid but there is a shrine just as holy right there - an Apple store!<br>\n<a href=""><img src="" alt="Apple Store at the Louvre"></a></p>\n<p> []: /2010/06/27/get-3g-internet-access-in-france-on-your-ipad/apple-louvre/</p>\n<p>Drop in there and chat with any of the guys in blue shirts. Tell them you want an SFR 3G microsim card. Most of the guys speak English and are really nice. The card will get you three days of unlimited data access and costs 9 euros. After that you can recharge the card at any kiosk around town - one day costs 6 euros. Do the math. Buying more sim cards is cheaper than trying to find a so I just bought two.</p>\n<p>Don\'t buy the ATT international plan before you come over and do take your microsim card out on the plane. If you don\'t have a plan data costs about $24 a meg. If you do have a plan it costs a bit more than $1 per meg.</p>\n<p>One other thing. You likely activated your iPad in the US so you won\'t have the right settings for the new SIM. Go into Cellular Data -> APN settings and then type in websfr for the APN. </p>\n<p>You should be good to go.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Get 3G internet access in Paris, France on your iPad",date:"June 27, 2010",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/get-3g-internet-access-in-france-on-your-ipad"}}}});
