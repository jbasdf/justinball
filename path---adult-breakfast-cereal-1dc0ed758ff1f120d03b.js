These kinds of cereal are easy to recognize in the store. They are on the top shelf well away from where the kids can yell, YUCK! They are typically boring - no shapes, no colors, no blatant sugar coating. I say blatant because like so many guilty adult pleasures the treat is hidden.</p>\n<p>When I started trying to lose weight, my friend and dietitian Lee told me to check out the cereal I was eating. What you will find is amazing.</p>\n<p>My Nature Valley granola bar cereal that costs something like a million dollars for a tiny box has 230 calories. that is a really big bar of chocolate worth of calories. It claims to be '100% Natural'. The second ingredient is corn syrup. I know it comes from corn, but it is not natural.</p>\n<p>My super healthy 'Go Lean' Kashi comes in at 190 as does my help me poop right Raisin Bran. Throw some blueberries on there like they show on the Kashi box and you may as well have another candy bar.</p>\n<p>So why does my kid's sugar frosted fruit loops come in at around 130 calories and have more vitamins?</p>\n<p>Cheerios comes in at 100 calories and I found a generic brand of bran flakes that is a very sliming 90.</p>\n<p>The adult cereals all claim to keep you fuller longer and maybe that is how they justify the extra calories, but no matter what I eat in the morning I am always hungry again by 10.</p>\n<p>I'm switching to fruit loops.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Adult Breakfast Cereal",date:"January 27, 2008",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/adult-breakfast-cereal"}}}});
