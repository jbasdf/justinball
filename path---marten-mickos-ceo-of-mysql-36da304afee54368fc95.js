So now “their” idea is to do what Google has done and get people to open source their data, share that data, then allow the world to access it like a database. “The biggest database in the world is already out there.” Build a “skype for databases.” You can go to Google to search, but the data is not all in the same format.</p>\n<p>Here are his considerations\nLatency is decreasing.\nWe may need a DNS of SQL Servers\nRouting may be an issue\nHow do you make data definitions available and understandable to others?\nPayments needed?\nUse RSS, Atom, HTML, HTTP etc as transport mechanisms.</p>\n<p>I don’t believe that this is their idea I am pretty sure that it came from the talk that Adam Bosworth gave at the MySQL conference last year. I agree that the web should be our next database - the wealth of data available could provide humanity with insane access to knowledge.</p>\n<p>One of the VCs on the first day talked about one of the problems their funded companies are having – latency. Given the time required to run a query in Ozmozr with 90k records I think it would be difficult to run that query over the internet to a thousand distributed databases.
