Given that both bikes have a similar geometry I expected the ride quality to be equal or for the 6.5 to have a slightly harsher feel do to the higher modulus carbon. The opposite was true and the 'Red' carbon on the 6.5 seem to be just a bit smoother than the 'Black' carbon on the 5.5. Of course the difference could also be attributed to the wheels. It is hard to say, but the overall package on the 6.5 offered a slightly sweeter ride.</p>\\n<p>There are currently a couple of 6.9 Madones available. I could have one here in a week.

This year Utah citizens have the option of either a <a href=\\\"http://www.senatesite.com/blog/2007/12/conservative-marries-progressive.html\\\">flat tax rate of 5.35</a>% or the standard 7% rate with deductions. The population of Utah is made up of a large number of members of the LDS church who pay a 'flat' 10% of their income as tithing. Therefore, I am sure that the 5.35% seems very appealing - even divine given its similarity to the tithing structure. However, I would be very interested in the overall effect of this tax on the general population. In my personal case the flat tax would have resulted in an increase of more than $1,000. Even though 5.35% is a smaller number than 7% the net result is a greater portion of my income going to the state. I don't think that my situation is much different than many Utahns so I wonder if others would also be adversely affected. Given that the country is moving towards recession now is not the time to increase taxes. I think that the intent of the flat tax is not only to simplify the tax structure, but also to reduce the tax burden. However, it fails on the later part. I think that the flat tax will disproportionally benefit the wealthy. Consider the constituency that benefits from tax deductions - families with children, home owners and those who tend to donate to charity (like churches). Those who are wealthy benefit from these deductions as well, but the deductions will constitute a smaller percent of their income forcing them to pay 7% on when the deductions stop helping. Under the flat tax their responsibility would drop to 5.35% on the greater part of their income.</p>\\n<p>These are my guesses. I would be interested to see an actual study that could help outline who will benefit and who will be adversely affected by the new tax structure. Utahns will have the chance to chose their tax system in November. It would be nice to have some hard facts.</p>\\n<p>Update: <a href=\\\"http://www.cppa.utah.edu/publications/finance_tax/PP_Evaluation_Utah_Tax.pdf\\\">Here's one study</a></p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-20-utah-flat-tax/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/utah-flat-tax\",\"date\":\"2008-03-20T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Utah Flat Tax\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I just got a notification about the status of Trek's Project One .

(If you think you are paying $1500 to learn about how Rails routes work then its time to rethink your life.) iPhones may not be ubiquitous yet, but they are popular enough that some social networks have started targeting them specifically. When bluetooth was born free thinkers imagined a meetup system that everyone on the network would use. Just set your phone to 'meet me' and you would find yourself swamped with babes in no time. 8 years later the network never emerged. The prospect of opening yourself up to anyone on the street was a little much to bear even by the dandiest socialite. Like so many other things in life - generic development platforms, my education, etc - the idea lacked context. Context sells.</p>\\n<p>Back to the iPhone. The phone has wifi. There is a sweet SDL available. Here goes. Build a rich 'intro to the virtual me' application. It can be as simple as I am Justin. I am a Ruby programmer. I would love to meet other Ruby programmers. Make it easy to store a number of profiles then when you attend a conference or social event set the profile most relevant to that setting public. Others in the wifi grid would see this along with the profiles of everyone else participating. Press the friend invite the other person gets a friend request - a virtual business card exchange. Add scheduling into the application so that ad-hoc meetups can be arranged. Throw in Twitter and blog integration so that you can follow what your new friends are saying and you have a powerful social exchange. The network can be formed anew for each event you attend and archived online to a social service. For the contacts you hit it off with you can become friends on Facebook, follow each other on Twitter, or add each other's blogs to your aggregator. Nerdy engineers rejoice. Now even the introduction can be virtual. No more of this messy, inefficient offline human interaction.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-16-a-killer-iphone-app/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/a-killer-iphone-app\",\"date\":\"2008-03-16T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"A Killer iPhone App\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I stay up very late writing code sometimes.

Ever since then the vast majority of the members have ignored this council and the overall level of guilt among the LDS faithful has continued to rise as each successive generation followed the example of the previous. Technology now provides some relief from the burden. Journal writing, a boring effort prompting statements like, \\\"I really should write in my journal but I need to clean the drains,\\\" has been replaced by the uber hip practice of blogging, Facebook profiles and lifestreams. If Brigham had only spun journal writing a little differently the church could have been oh so cool. An early prophesy encouraging rich Myspace profile development could have shaken the very foundations of cool society.\\nAs our real lives become more and more intertwined with our virtual lives the amount of data being stored about our daily lives is beginning to fill millions of Gigabytes in the 'cloud'. Much of this data is collected or generated with little effort. Twitter makes it easy to keep a timeline of your life. WordPress, Typepad, or Blogspot make heavier entry creation simple. <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com\\\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.friendfeed.com\\\">FriendFeed</a> make sharing your life simple and del.cio.us keeps track of everything that's interesting to you.</p>\\n<p>For genealogists or family historians the next step is to find a way to aggregate and then store all this information long term. This is harder than it sounds, but invaluable for personal history and online identity. The trick becomes controlling the data that becomes part of your 'permanent record'. While pictures of you downing jello shots with your buddies might be funny to you and your buddies now, unless you are my brother in law Brad you don't want that distributed in the family newsletter. Nor would you want your kids reading about that 20 years from now. 150 years from now however the information becomes historical, less incriminating and it could become a more interesting part of your identity. There is a historian in the small town where my dad grew up who kept track of simple histories of everyone buried in the local cemetery. When those people were alive they would not have loved for people to know that they were a horse thief, adulterer, gambler etc, but for some reason a couple of generations later that information becomes a colorful and interesting part of the family history. Being able to seal up your more personal deeds for 150 years could be an interesting option for a personal history aggregator/archiver.</p>\\n<p>The monotonous task of personal history has given way to the popular methods of keeping a virtual life. While the term 'lifestream' sounds more fun than 'personal history' the two activities are not dissimilar and offer and opportunity for everyone to gather their history without much effort.

All of these companies have open and collaborative technology, use social networking and focus on family relations and because of that formula are extremely successful.</p>\\n<p>Guesses there are 70 billion records in the world and they have 6 billion records and 3 billions images in the 'vault.' Over half of all children have no official record of their existence. What they currently have will require about 24 petabytes of storage. Records in the vault are stored by contract not owned. Therefore they must work with others. They want to collaborate. They want a free flow of data into open repositories and want to work with commercial entities and non-profits to help encourage world wide genealogy.</p>\\n<p>They are moving away from acquiring information to providing access to information. Moving away from producing products to building a platorm. Moving towards becoming open and sharing information. They are developing APIs and standards to help other organizations succeed.</p>\\n<p>They have been known as the Genealogy society of Utah but have changed the name to FamilySearch to represent their broader global focus. Also, lets them work with commercial and non profit organizations.</p>\\n<p>Volunteers currently produce more than 1.7M names a day - that is a total, given that records are entered through a double blind system not that many names go in. Want to get around 300,000 people involved over the next few years.</p>\\n<p>Their webservices will let you link into richer content to records stored in the family tree. A couple of years ago guys from the Internet Archive came to our conference at Utah State and talked about the massive amount of data they are storing. This included wedding videos and other home videos. Flickr lets you upload photos. Youtube lets you upload videos. It would be interesting if you could build a mashup that let you store digital artifacts in existing systems and link that into family search. The thin layer that makes that possible would be interesting. As a side note BYU's great inappropriate content filter just blocked access to the Internet Archive.

Given that both bikes have a similar geometry I expected the ride quality to be equal or for the 6.5 to have a slightly harsher feel do to the higher modulus carbon. The opposite was true and the 'Red' carbon on the 6.5 seem to be just a bit smoother than the 'Black' carbon on the 5.5. Of course the difference could also be attributed to the wheels.

This year Utah citizens have the option of either a <a href=\\\"http://www.senatesite.com/blog/2007/12/conservative-marries-progressive.html\\\">flat tax rate of 5.35</a>% or the standard 7% rate with deductions. The population of Utah is made up of a large number of members of the LDS church who pay a 'flat' 10% of their income as tithing. Therefore, I am sure that the 5.35% seems very appealing - even divine given its similarity to the tithing structure. However, I would be very interested in the overall effect of this tax on the general population. In my personal case the flat tax would have resulted in an increase of more than $1,000. Even though 5.35% is a smaller number than 7% the net result is a greater portion of my income going to the state. I don't think that my situation is much different than many Utahns so I wonder if others would also be adversely affected. Given that the country is moving towards recession now is not the time to increase taxes. I think that the intent of the flat tax is not only to simplify the tax structure, but also to reduce the tax burden. However, it fails on the later part. I think that the flat tax will disproportionally benefit the wealthy. Consider the constituency that benefits from tax deductions - families with children, home owners and those who tend to donate to charity (like churches). Those who are wealthy benefit from these deductions as well, but the deductions will constitute a smaller percent of their income forcing them to pay 7% on when the deductions stop helping. Under the flat tax their responsibility would drop to 5.35% on the greater part of their income.</p>\\n<p>These are my guesses. I would be interested to see an actual study that could help outline who will benefit and who will be adversely affected by the new tax structure. Utahns will have the chance to chose their tax system in November. It would be nice to have some hard facts.</p>\\n<p>Update: <a href=\\\"http://www.cppa.utah.edu/publications/finance_tax/PP_Evaluation_Utah_Tax.pdf\\\">Here's one study</a></p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-20-utah-flat-tax/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/utah-flat-tax\",\"date\":\"2008-03-20T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Utah Flat Tax\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I just got a notification about the status of Trek's Project One .

(If you think you are paying $1500 to learn about how Rails routes work then its time to rethink your life.) iPhones may not be ubiquitous yet, but they are popular enough that some social networks have started targeting them specifically. When bluetooth was born free thinkers imagined a meetup system that everyone on the network would use. Just set your phone to 'meet me' and you would find yourself swamped with babes in no time. 8 years later the network never emerged. The prospect of opening yourself up to anyone on the street was a little much to bear even by the dandiest socialite. Like so many other things in life - generic development platforms, my education, etc - the idea lacked context. Context sells.</p>\\n<p>Back to the iPhone. The phone has wifi. There is a sweet SDL available. Here goes. Build a rich 'intro to the virtual me' application. It can be as simple as I am Justin. I am a Ruby programmer. I would love to meet other Ruby programmers. Make it easy to store a number of profiles then when you attend a conference or social event set the profile most relevant to that setting public. Others in the wifi grid would see this along with the profiles of everyone else participating. Press the friend invite the other person gets a friend request - a virtual business card exchange. Add scheduling into the application so that ad-hoc meetups can be arranged. Throw in Twitter and blog integration so that you can follow what your new friends are saying and you have a powerful social exchange. The network can be formed anew for each event you attend and archived online to a social service. For the contacts you hit it off with you can become friends on Facebook, follow each other on Twitter, or add each other's blogs to your aggregator. Nerdy engineers rejoice. Now even the introduction can be virtual.

Ever since then the vast majority of the members have ignored this council and the overall level of guilt among the LDS faithful has continued to rise as each successive generation followed the example of the previous. Technology now provides some relief from the burden. Journal writing, a boring effort prompting statements like, \\\"I really should write in my journal but I need to clean the drains,\\\" has been replaced by the uber hip practice of blogging, Facebook profiles and lifestreams. If Brigham had only spun journal writing a little differently the church could have been oh so cool. An early prophesy encouraging rich Myspace profile development could have shaken the very foundations of cool society.\\nAs our real lives become more and more intertwined with our virtual lives the amount of data being stored about our daily lives is beginning to fill millions of Gigabytes in the 'cloud'. Much of this data is collected or generated with little effort. Twitter makes it easy to keep a timeline of your life. WordPress, Typepad, or Blogspot make heavier entry creation simple. <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com\\\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.friendfeed.com\\\">FriendFeed</a> make sharing your life simple and del.cio.us keeps track of everything that's interesting to you.</p>\\n<p>For genealogists or family historians the next step is to find a way to aggregate and then store all this information long term. This is harder than it sounds, but invaluable for personal history and online identity. The trick becomes controlling the data that becomes part of your 'permanent record'. While pictures of you downing jello shots with your buddies might be funny to you and your buddies now, unless you are my brother in law Brad you don't want that distributed in the family newsletter. Nor would you want your kids reading about that 20 years from now. 150 years from now however the information becomes historical, less incriminating and it could become a more interesting part of your identity. There is a historian in the small town where my dad grew up who kept track of simple histories of everyone buried in the local cemetery. When those people were alive they would not have loved for people to know that they were a horse thief, adulterer, gambler etc, but for some reason a couple of generations later that information becomes a colorful and interesting part of the family history. Being able to seal up your more personal deeds for 150 years could be an interesting option for a personal history aggregator/archiver.</p>\\n<p>The monotonous task of personal history has given way to the popular methods of keeping a virtual life.

It forces us to focus on what needs to be done rather than spend time shooting the bull.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-14-starting-up/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/starting-up\",\"date\":\"2008-03-14T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Starting Up\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"If these posts don't make sense sorry.

Luckily caffeine is my friend and I managed to stay awake for the drive down. I did discover this morning that my truck's top speed is 75 MPH and that it is scary to drive it that fast.</p>\\n<p>Here are some highlights from the keynote.</p>\\n<p>Ransom Love is talking about Social Networking and is showing <a href=\\\"http://www.geni.com/\\\">Geni</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.ifamily.net/\\\">FamilyBuilder</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.worldvitalrecords.com/\\\">WorldVitalRecords</a> - especially their Facebook application 'We're Related'. All of these companies have open and collaborative technology, use social networking and focus on family relations and because of that formula are extremely successful.</p>\\n<p>Guesses there are 70 billion records in the world and they have 6 billion records and 3 billions images in the 'vault.' Over half of all children have no official record of their existence. What they currently have will require about 24 petabytes of storage. Records in the vault are stored by contract not owned. Therefore they must work with others. They want to collaborate. They want a free flow of data into open repositories and want to work with commercial entities and non-profits to help encourage world wide genealogy.</p>\\n<p>They are moving away from acquiring information to providing access to information. Moving away from producing products to building a platorm. Moving towards becoming open and sharing information. They are developing APIs and standards to help other organizations succeed.</p>\\n<p>They have been known as the Genealogy society of Utah but have changed the name to FamilySearch to represent their broader global focus. Also, lets them work with commercial and non profit organizations.</p>\\n<p>Volunteers currently produce more than 1.7M names a day - that is a total, given that records are entered through a double blind system not that many names go in. Want to get around 300,000 people involved over the next few years.</p>\\n<p>Their webservices will let you link into richer content to records stored in the family tree. A couple of years ago guys from the Internet Archive came to our conference at Utah State and talked about the massive amount of data they are storing. This included wedding videos and other home videos. Flickr lets you upload photos. Youtube lets you upload videos. It would be interesting if you could build a mashup that let you store digital artifacts in existing systems and link that into family search. The thin layer that makes that possible would be interesting. As a side note BYU's great inappropriate content filter just blocked access to the Internet Archive. Lame.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-12-family-search-conference/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/family-search-conference\",\"date\":\"2008-03-12T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Family Search Conference\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"What do we read out of family search?

They are doing some cool things by connecting living people with their families and to the larger family graph.   They also let you upload photos and other digital assets then assemble that into a timeline.  Eventually you will be able to create a family timeline.</p>\\n<p>On to the FamilyTree Write.  This part of the API seems to be mainly applicable to software packages that want to contribute data to FamilySearch.  I am more of a data mooch than a data provider so it isn't as interesting but here goes:</p>\\n<p>Only the <em>assertions</em> section of the entry is writable.\\nIn version 1.1 the <em>summary</em> section will be writable.\\nOnly the assertion value can be changed.  ie you can't just change the date of an event.  You have to change all parts of the event - the date, the place, the type (birth, death, etc) and the description.  If you left out the place or type it would update the date and delete the place and type.</p>\\n<p>After you post you will get back a skeleton of the person which is really gross, but most of the people are probably dead so at least it won't hurt.  :-)  You only get back the IDs of the person so that you can map the object that was created to an object in your database.</p>\\n<p>If you pass some bad data you will get errors or the parts of the request that fails.  They won't fail the entire request just the bad parts.</p>\\n<p>To write you create an xml document:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"xml\\\">\\n<familytree version=\\\"1.0\\\" xmlns=\\\"api.familysearch.org/familytree/v1\\\">\\n  <persons>\\n    <person>\\n      <assertions>\\n        <name type=\\\"name\\\"></name>\\n        <event type=\\\"Birth\\\" id=\\\"..\\\">...</event>\\n      </assertions>\\n    <person>\\n  <persons>\\n</familytree>\\n</pre></code>\\n<br />\\n<p>\\nTo Delete:\\n</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"xml\\\">\\n<familytree version=\\\"1.0\\\" xmlns=\\\"api.familysearch.org/familytree/v1\\\">\\n  <persons>\\n    <person id=\\\"KW3b-2HB\\\" fsaction:action=\\\"delete\\\">\\n    <person>\\n  <persons>\\n</familytree>\\n</pre></code>\\n<br />\\n<p>\\nYou can only change or delete assertions that you have contributed.  However, they have created a \\\"disputed\\\" assertion so that you can make correction to bad data.\\n<p>Create a new assertion with the same values except for the disputed value.  Then set disputed=true.</p>\\n<p>The system is person centric.  All relationships for a given person are stored with the person.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-03-12-family-search-write/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/family-search-write\",\"date\":\"2008-03-12T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Family Search Write\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}}],\"pathPrefix\":\"archive\",\"first\":false,\"last\":false,\"index\":19,\"pageCount\":33}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/archive-19.json\n// module id = 1061\n// module chunks = 204170011566594"],"sourceRoot":""}
