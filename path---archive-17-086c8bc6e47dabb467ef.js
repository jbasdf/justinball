Nobody listens anyway. After years of promising my wife we would go on vacation to Disneyland with the kids, we finally made it. Some people make this trek frequently - one of Callie's mom's friends goes 4 times a year.</p>\n<p>That's a bit too happy for me.</p>\n<p>I had been to Disneyland once before. I was in high school and our jazz band performed there. Afterwards they gave us a food voucher and admittance for one day. I think I rode two rides and searched high and low for a place that would take the food voucher. If I remember correctly, I went hungry because we couldn't find anywhere cheap enough to use the food voucher.</p>\n<p>Disneyland is the 'happiest place on earth'. They go to great lengths to make that fact true. If you so much as drop a candy wrapper or sneeze there is a team on site, dressed in white and looking cheery, to ensure that mess is cleaned up within nano seconds. There aren't even any bugs around. Not sure how they pull that off and I'm not sure I want to know.</p>\n<p>During my time in college, I stood in some long lines. These were to pay tuition or to get into a class. They were nothing compared to the happiest lines on earth. Disneyland is a place where you spend the majority of 3 days standing in line for the opportunity to ride for a few minutes. Wait time to play time is somewhere in the range of 1 hour riding to 24 hours waiting. At least they make it a happy wait time, you are usually in the shade and frequently surrounded by something that is spinning, blinking or talking. If that isn't entertaining enough then you can just look around. The characters attending Disneyland are as amusing as Mickey and sometimes as scary as Maleficent. I didn't really feel like I could let go of my kids hands very often. I don't love large crowds, and I am pretty sure if your kids managed to get very far away from you they would be lost forever. Although I didn't notice security people stationed around and I am sure they would help you out with a smile. Of course, if you broke down into tears they would quickly whisk you away to a happy place so you didn't spoil anyone else's happiness.</p>\n<p>We went to the Haunted House first. This was to be my daughter's very first experience with Disneyland. Aubrey left the place in tears. I was pretty sure they were done with Disney at that point. To really make them hate life we took them on Splash Mountain next. Aubrey didn't trust us much after that. Maybe with a lot of therapy sometime around college graduation she will love us again. After those rides we stuck pretty much with Pooh Bear, the Tea Cups, Alice in Wonderland and Astroblasters (a Buzz Lightyear thing). Of all the rides the girls liked the Astroblasters the best. We rode it 5 times. That gets boring, but they loved it. I don't get why there are older people on some of these rides. Seriously people, after they age of 12 or so why are you standing in line to ride Alice or Astroblasters or Pooh Bear if you don't have kids? I don't get that, but then I probably wouldn't be at Disneyland if I didn't have kids. I would be in Moab or Europe or in bed. I think I would probably be in bed. That would be an awesome vacation. Disneyland makes you very tired.</p>\n<p>The girls loved the Tea Cups. They were very funny on that ride and surprisingly I didn't puke even though I rode it quite a few times. They were terrified of the Story Book ride because you float into the mouth of a toothy whale. (Whales don't have teeth, what is Disney teaching our kids?) We rode it once and then they wanted to go over and over. The lines to Snow White and Pinocchio were short so we rode those. They are the same ride with different disturbing images from a couple of pretty creepy movies. I'm still glad the lines were short.</p>\n<p>We rode on Mr Toad's wild ride which is just like the Snow White and Pinocchio rides except that at the end you go to hell and it is very hot. I guess I need to do some research. Maybe the ride should be called Mr Toad goes to hell don't ride this when it is hot outside.</p>\n<p>Aubrey desperately wanted to ride Peter Pan so we stood in line for 4 hours (45 minutes, but it feels like 4 hours). That ride is a bit more interesting than they previous 3 simply because you fly in a ship over lots of Christmas lights that look like stars. The girls loved it. I say they can put up the Christmas lights next year and hang off a ladder while reaching for the next hook. The adrenaline rush is similar and you still get to see Christmas light stars.</p>\n<p>Its too bad Jenna wasn't taller. She was brave and up for pretty much anything but the height restrictions kept her of a few things. We went to California Adventure. They have a Brother Bear tree house, hike, wilderness area where you walk around on ropes and feel like you are in the woods (as opposed to going to the actual forrest). They do a tire swing (jumper training I think they call it.) They wouldn't let Jenna ride because she was an inch to short. They will let her ride on roller coasters, but heaven forbid she swing from a tire six inches off the ground. She cried. In Toon Town I stood in line with all the girls for 30 minutes only to have Aubrey and Alyssa refuse to get on at the last second. Jenna rode it with Leslie. At the end Dave and Leslie said she was lit like a candle. We might have to come back someday just to let her ride some of the more thrilling rides.</p>\n<p>I paid the most I have ever paid for a meal at Ariel's grotto. It was a Disney princess breakfast. The girls loved it. It was a good meal and I didn't have to stand in line or haul food around. It was worth it for those last two facts and hey the girls got buttons. We took the girls to the Bug's Life rides. Aubrey got to ride bumper cars there (that go .00001 mph). They wouldn't let Devin ride. Pirates of the Caribbean is fine, but Grandma's Florida bumper car experience is to dangerous.</p>\n<p>We did make it to Soaring over California which is a cool experience. They freak you out by buckling you and hauling you ten feet off the ground. It successfully freaked Alyssa out. She cried through most of it, but the visual effect is impressive. They even spray smelly stuff in the air so when you fly over an orange grove its kind of like replacing those little tree things in your car. Very special.</p>\n<p>All the kids loved the Carousel which was great because that line is short. If you want to ride Pirates of the Caribbean go during Fantasmic because you will be pretty much the only one on the ride. If you are going to eat in the park which you may as well do because leaving means walking a long ways then there is a Mexican place which isn't to bad and the New Orleans area is decent. Downtown Disney has some places we walked by that smell nice and California Adventure has nice restaurants (the food at Ariel's Grotto was good). Expect to pay somewhere around what you make in a month for food. It really isn't cheap, but at least you will be happy to give them your money because after all it is the Happiest Place on Earth.</p>\n<p>Before I forget here's a time breakdown:\nStanding in line 5 hours\nRiding rides 1 hour\nShopping 6 hours\nFiguring out where to go next 8 hours\nWalking 100 hours (ok 10 hours or so, but if feels like 100. My feet still hurt)\nUsing the happiest bathrooms on earth 4 hours.\nThere were shows, fireworks and characters mixed in there as well.</p>\n<p>I and my wife had fun but more important my kids had a really great time.</p>\n<p>I guess we are happy now.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-02-im-just-so-happy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/im-just-so-happy",date:"2008-06-02T06:00:00Z",title:"I&#8217;m Just so Happy",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:'I wrote this on May 11th but never got around to posting it: We took the kids to Thanksgiving Point yesterday to look at the gardens.

The signs were not in our favor and we ended up down a dead end road. We turned around and made our way through some of the darker areas of that part\nof town until we saw a lot of cars and chose to follow them. That led us to the store. Who says following the crowd doesn\'t work? We made it to the mall just before closing.\nAll the kids needed to use the facilities at that point so at 10 at night we hauled all the kids into the store so they could pee. As we stepped in the front door our quest\nwas almost over before it started. Right as we walked in the front door there was a sign that said \'Restrooms\'. We started walking down the short hall but there were only two doors\nand neither looked like a restroom. The arrow pointing towards relief was aimed downward. We assumed that the arrow had been turned somehow and that the restrooms were somewhere close.\nWe walked through the store and ran into a salesman he haughtily told us, "they are downstairs." I said, "that\'s good because the sign back there made me wonder if we were supposed to pee on the floor." He was a suite salesman and not amused.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-05-23-watching-for-signs/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/watching-for-signs",date:"2008-05-23T06:00:00Z",title:"Watching for Signs",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Aubrey's teacher asked her students to draw a picture of what makes them yawn.

Then I called Joel and said let\'s go for a ride. He was good with the idea so we headed towards Black Smith Fork Canyon. This is one of my favorite rides. It is a reasonable evening ride - a 42 mile loop from my house. It is also a great section to throw onto a longer Saturday ride.</p>\n<p>Given that I had a lot going on and that it was my first ride of the season I was going to be lazy and stop at the end of Old Hollow Road which isn\'t really that far from my house. When we go to the end of Old Hollow Road we decided that we were feeling pretty good so we kept going to the power plant which is not quite half way up the canyon. We still felt good so to the top of the canyon we went. That was a great time. I felt great. The scenery was beautiful - there was still snow on the mountains up there so it was also cold.</p>\n<p>Black Smith Fork is a tricky canyon. You push on the way up because it is uphill, but you assume that coming back will be easy because it is downhill. If you assume that you\'re a damn fool. The still air on the way up and the ease at which you ascend is the first sign that something is not right. After you revel in your accomplishment at the top you face the wind the entire way back down the canyon. I know this. I have had ridden this canyon many times and yet I ignore the facts that have been emblazoned into my brain from every ride before. However, the scenery is addictive. Like a Black Widow louring and then devouring her mate Black Smith Fork will draw you to the top and then sap the life out of you on the way back. Typically only divorce lawyers are so skilled and cold hearted.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.justinball.com/2007/08/08/rode-blacksmith-fork-canyon-tonight/">The last time I did this ride without sufficient nutrition I bonked</a> and I told myself that I had learned my lesson. I guess I have to relearn that lesson once a year. My skipping of lunch and dependence on two 90 calorie granola bars resulted in a painful bonk again towards the end. It wasn\'t as bad this time. I didn\'t go nuts like the time before, but the million little bugs gnawing the muscle off my leg bones told me I had depleted all my energy reserves.</p>\n<p>Lycra isn\'t an especially good insulator. I did have the sense to put on a smart wool base layer and some full finger gloves, but other than that it was pretty much me against the 40 degree weather. I don\'t like to get to hot so I typically under dress. After a while I figured I could probably cut off my toes and eat them for sustenance if required. I couldn\'t feel them anyway. When I did make it home it took three hours to warm back up in spite of a hot shower. The snow on the hills around us should have been a clue.</p>\n<p>I blame it on the bike.</p>\n<p>I have a brand new 2008 Trek Madone 6.9. To me there isn\'t a sweeter bike. It is a beautiful bike - a piece of art. Every time I find myself in the garage I have to stare at it or touch it. It calls to me and begs to be ridden. I am disgusting. I love that bike.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-047-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">This bike begs to be ridden</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9289.jpg"><img src="img_9289-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">Up close</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-041-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Other side</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Back to the ride. The hills were non-existent. The pavement smoothed by the carbon frame, my back didn\'t exhibit its usual total break down that results in my inability to stand up for days. The Bontrager XXX Lite wheels are so light and smooth that you barely notice they are there at all. They spin up fast and roll like butter on a hot grill.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9286.jpg"><img src="img_9286-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">Carbon is Nice</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-052-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">These are light as air</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It took me a while to decide on whether to go with SRAM Red or Dura Ace. I thought I might regret the Dura Ace, but it is silky smooth. My last bike with Shimano 105 had a hard time. Shifting the front ring was like playing BlackJack. You had about a 49% chance of it actually working. I almost died once because when I tried to shift it failed and dropped the chain while I was crossing a road. I am sure the oncoming truck was a little surprised and probably ticked when I jumped off the bike and ran across the road just in time to miss becoming road kill. I don\'t even notice the shift now. This is especially encouraging because I wasn\'t a fan of the Race X Lite crank at first. I am sure it isn\'t the stiffest but it is dependable and smooth.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-048-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Not so bad after all</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-035-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Silky smooth as ever</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-056-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">You won\'t even notice the shift on the front rings</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The frame cannot be beat. I have it hanging on the wall in my garage next to my Santa Cruz Blur XC.\nThat is my kind of art gallery. If it wasn\'t so much more fun to ride the bikes I could just sit there and stare at them all day. The paint job is sweet. Next to my wife it is the sexiest thing I have seen. (Thanks for letting me buy the new bike dear).</p>\n<p>I have a bad back - degenerated disk - so for me a comfy ride has to take priority over a super stiff frame. Don\'t take that to mean the frame isn\'t stiff. It is and it responds well. It smooths out the nasty bumps in the road but is still there for me when I stand up to pound on the pedals. The road noise that was uncomfortable on my aluminum bike turns into a hum that keeps you connected to the pavement without vibrating you to death.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-037-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">The seat mast helps to stiffen the frame but still provides a comfortable ride</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9290.jpg"><img src="img_9290-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-054-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>On my previous bike I was always a bit nervous to look behind me as I had a hard time keeping the bike going straight. I feel more comfortable on this bike. It likes to go straight even though I am not great at maintaining a straight line. You don\'t think about corners. The bike glides around them in a controlled smooth line. When you look at the spokes on the Race XXX Lite wheels you\'d think you\'d snap them if you weigh more than a teenage girl but they hold up just fine and in fact aren\'t mushy at all. I was worried I\'d feel them sloshing back and forth against the brake pads if I stood up to pound on the pedals but nothing of the sort happened. For reference I weight between 170 and 175 depending on the time of day.</p>\n<p>There are a few downsides to the bike. I thought that the Race X Lite crank would be one, but as it turns out it works just fine. If Dura Ace made a compact crank I would demand that, but Shimano is late to that party. The big downside? The literature states that it comes with the SRAM 1090 Powerdome cassette, but when I pulled the bike out of the box at the shop it was wearing the 1070 cassette. I had the shop call Trek. Their reply was that the specs are subject to change anytime, we couldn\'t get them so sorry you\'re screwed. I find it odd that there seem to be plenty available on eBay and Specialized managed to find some for their new Tarmac SL2. Astana is running SRAM Red so you\'d think some kind of inside deal would be possible. The largest bike company in the world with a team sponsorship couldn\'t get them? Also notice that they didn\'t lower the price a corresponding amount. Trek gets a big fat F here. This was the big disappointment in an otherwise perfect experience.</p>\n<p>The only other downside is minor and probably common to most bikes. Some of the decals are not especially clean. I see a few jagged edges here and there. You\'ll have to click through to the large picture on the seat post joint to even notice. I guess that might be one argument for Project One - there are no decals everything is painted on.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-050-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">The 1070 cassette should have been a 1090</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-057-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I had the shop install my Polar CS600 on the bike. The guys at the shop told me that the power unit wouldn\'t quite fit when in the small front ring and the bottom three rings on the back without the chain running right on top of the sensor. Turns out they were wrong. (They also never finished installing all the sensors but still charged me full price.) The powerful magnet pulls the chain down when there is any slack but pedaling shows that there is plenty of clearance. I was a bit freaked out at first since I was worried my nice computer wouldn\'t work with my nice bike but it runs out that everything is fine.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9284.jpg"><img src="img_9284-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">The Polar CS600 unit fits just fine</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-053-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Polar CS600 Computer on the bars</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-055-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Polar CS600 Computer on the bars</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Even after spending a year doing research and saving money I was nervous about spending a small fortune on a bicycle. If you view it as a bike that is worth than my truck then you might need to be treated for hyperventilation. The retail on this bike with tax will take you north of $8k. However, where I live plenty of people have several four wheelers or motor bikes in their garage. Others have camp trailers or jet skis. Even I have an old motor bike. I use it once a year. Most of the people around me are probably in the same situation with their toys. Here\'s the thing - I ride my bike everyday. Since I have started riding I have dropped 30 lbs and I no longer breath heavy when I climb a flight of stairs. Sure a cheaper bike would do the same thing, but if you just can\'t resist and you can scrape together the cash you won\'t regret parking one of these in the garage.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-29-first-real-ride-on-the-new-trek-madone-69/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/first-real-ride-on-the-new-trek-madone-69",date:"2008-04-29T06:00:00Z",title:"First Real Ride on the New Trek Madone 6.9",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/picture-047-f44d8d648e1e77c3db38445b06677354-381d6.jpg"}}}}}},{node:{excerpt:"The next time you take a bite out of that yummy loaf of bread consider where it came from.

I used <a href="http://rfacebook.rubyforge.org/">rfacebook</a> because that is the library I have used in the past and could quickly get the application done.\n(<a href="http://facebooker.rubyforge.org/">Facebooker</a> is another library worth looking at if you are building a Facebok Application). I deployed the application but it wouldn\'t start. I did some checking and finally found their deployment log.\nTurns out the Facebook gems are not installed. <a href="http://errtheblog.com/posts/50-vendor-everything">There is a way to package up your gems into your project</a>. (<a href="http://gemsonrails.rubyforge.org/">This site will help as well</a>.)\nWith the popularity of Facebook applications growing and the need for scalability on demand I would think that having the Facebook gems already in place would be a must for a platform like MorphExchange.\nI submitted a ticket yesterday and haven\'t heard back yet. Hopefully they are responsive. I deployed on Morph for the speed of deployment.

It wasn't, but there are still a few bugs. They are probably my fault, but I think there is a great opportunity to integrate this software into ecommerce sites like mine to provide customers a really cool method for quickly browsing product. It works especially well with <a href=\"http://www.theplancollection.com/house-plans\">house plans</a>. (Follow the link. If you have PicLens installed you can press the little blue play button in the upper right of your browser. If not click on the 'View as Slideshow' link).</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of things I would love to see them add/change. I noticed that in the flash slide show the player pulls in the 'description' field from the RSS but the Firefox Extension does not. We added a bunch of info about each house plan into that field so it helps our users get more information about the plan as they are viewing the slideshow.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if there was a more obvious way to click through to view the web page of the image you are viewing. Right now you can click on the title and it will take you, but that took me a minute to figure out and I am betting my users won't know to do that.</p>\n<p>I followed the advanced integration tutorial and added paging to my atom and rss feeds but as far as I can tell the only images you can view are the ones on the current page. I would love to be able to view all 18,000 plans in the viewer. I messed up on my RSS feed. The paging works great.</p>\n<p>Now I am off to show this off to my wife. It looks pretty. Nobody cares when I spend a week getting a database schema just right, but when I build something that looks pretty I get praise.

After months of deliberating size, components and Project One or stock I walked into the shop this morning and put my money down on a Madone 6.9. Yesterday by total chance I was in Ogden and so was the Trek demo team. They helped me get setup on with the right size which is one of the things that has held me back so far. I really wanted to get SRAM Red on the bike, but I have heard from a few people that it still has some bugs. It would probably work fine for me, but I know that Dura Ace is a great group and will run just fine. </p>\n<p>A couple of things turned me to the stock bike instead of a Project One. There are currently 3 stock 6.9s at Trek. I managed to get one so my bike will be here in 7 days. Project One was going to take anywhere from 5 weeks to 2 months. I can wait that long, but I have to really want to. I love the paint job on the stock bike so the only reason I was going with Project One was the Red Grouppo. The Trek rep and a couple of other guys convinced me that for the money the Dura Ace group would be just as good and with the stock bike I end up with the Race XXX Lite wheels instead of the Race X Lite wheels.</p>\n<p>The biggest disappointment on this bike is the crankset. On a $7700 bike you\'d think they could do better than a Race X Lite crank. When you spend that much it also seems like they could let you change a few things - I will have to get rid of the stock stem and buy another one to get the right fit.</p>\n<p>I will write a full review with pictures when the bike comes.

For a while I was tempted to go with the 5.2, but why be responsible when you can spend an insane amount of money to shave a pound off your bike? This morning I went to Thanksgiving Point to an Apple Educator Conference. We were just a few miles from the Trek store, but I didn't feel right using a University car to engage in my hobbies so we didn't go. When I got home my wife mentioned that she needed to run some errands in Ogden and when should we go? I knew there was a shop in that area that had a couple of Madones so I figure I can endure fabric stores for a visit to the bike shop. </p>\n<p>It was totally worth the effort. I walk in the door of the shop and start chatting with guys. They tell me that Trek just so happens to be in town doing test rides. I get my butt up to the Weber State Stadium (location of said test rides) as fast as I can. Sure enough they had several Madones and I was able to spend time figuring out the right size. They swapped stems and frames. I wish I would have know they would be there. I would have taken my bike clothes and shoes. At any rate, we figured out that the 58\" is a better fit. I used a 90mm stem with a 17 degree rise. I wonder if a 12 degree wouldn't be better, but I might not find a Bontrager stem with those specs. That is fine.</p>\n<p>I was pretty sure I was going to do a Project One so that I could get a SRAM Red groupset. The guys around here lean that way. The guys at the shop down there and the Trek rep both said that for the money they would go with the stock bike. The price works out such that I can do a stock Trek 6.9 and get Race XXX Lite wheels or do a Project One with Race X Lite but get the Red Group. It is a hard call. Maybe it shouldn't be. I still don't know what to do. I don't want 2008 to be over before I get a new bike. I really wish I could get the new Dura Ace 7900 but we won't see that until September which means it won't ship until next spring.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-17-2008-trek-madone-dilema/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/2008-trek-madone-dilema",date:"2008-04-17T06:00:00Z",title:"2008 Trek Madone Dilema",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"I recently wrote about Cloud Computing.

I said I would check it out. He said he would hold me to it. Last night I spent a little quality with Morph and now have a few impressions to share.</p>\n<p>First, adding your application to Morph is a bit confusing. It is setup as an 'application exchange' so instead of signing up for hosting you 'subscribe' to the Morph DevCenter. Once you do that you create a new 'Appspace'. Once you get past the oddity of how to get going the next part is very easy. You click one button to create the database. Then you click another to download a Capistrano file. By default it is named morph_deploy.rb but I renamed mine to just deploy so I don't have to tell Capistrano the name of the file every time I want to deploy. Add the deploy.rb to your project, edit it and set your subversion repository, do a cap deploy:morph, enter your username and password and you are ready to go. In just a few minutes your application is up and running on Morph Exchange. At first I was confused about the database. I couldn't figure out what values I should be setting in my database.yml file, but then I realized that Morph takes care of that for you. You never set the production settings for your database you just do the deploy and go. Also, it is important to note that your database migrations must be compatible with PostGreSQL. </p>\n<p>Morph Exhange gives you a developer account for free. That includes 1GB worth of storage and 1GB worth of transfer. I found it difficult to find <a href=\"http://www.morphexchange.com/map_info#pricing\">pricing on the site</a>. It is a bit hidden. You'll find it under DevCenter then select the pricing tab. The cost of the service isn't bad. The developer account is free. One step up is $31 a month. (Morph Exchange uses 'Morph Credits' but one credit = one dollar). The pricing goes up from there all the way to $1023 a month. The pricing didn't seem to bad until I really spent time thinking about it. The $1023 a month service comes with 250GB of storage and 250GB of bandwidth. The bandwidth is the shop stopper for me. The <a href=\"http://www.theplancollection.com\" title=\"house plans and architectural information from The Plan Collection\">ThePlancollection.com</a> is not a huge ecommerce site but still burns around 300GB of bandwidth a month. Morph Exchange would not be a good option if you are planning on serving a lot of data to a lot of people which makes me wonder if it is a good option. The point of cloud computing is the ability to scale which means you will serve out a lot of data. In Morph terms that means a lot of money. On the lower end for $93 a month you get 15GB of bandwidth. This blog doesn't get a whole lot of traffic but I am pretty sure I serve that much data per month. If it cost me $93 a month I wouldn't be blogging. </p>\n<p>For comparison Joyent will let you serve 10TB of data a month even if you are only using their $45 a month plan. I know that you won't be able to serve that much data from a $45 a month account - you will overwhelm the server long before you hit that limit - but what they are saying is we don't care how much you serve. Instead they are focusing on helping you scale up your CPU resources to meet customer demand. That seems like a more reasonable model.</p>\n<p>Mosso has an interesting model as well. Their plan starts at $100 a month. They don't measure your output in bandwidth but in requests. For $100 you get 3 million requests. After that it costs 3¢ per 1,000 requests. I don't care for that model either. I would rather spend my days worrying about providing enough CPU power to keep my app responsive for my customers and not worrying about how many requests my customers are making. Services like this actually encourage the provider to find ways to serve less items to their customers. You start re-architecting your application so that it won't serve as many items at a time. Remember that each file and each image is a new request so your best be here is to reduce images, css files and javascript files. You don't get ssh access to Mosso either which can be good and bad depending on how deeply involved you want to be with your hosting company. It also makes you feel like you have to chase away the free loaders like some grouchy old shop keeper - don't come look at my products unless you intend to buy.</p>\n<p>Since I am wearing my EngineYard shirt today I'll throw them into the mix. I consider these guys to be the Ferrari of Ruby on Rails hosting. They were at the Mountain West Ruby conference. I spent some time eavesdropping while hanging out in their suite at the hotel. These guys are as core to the future of Rails as 37 Signals. They know what they are doing. However, <a href=\"http://www.engineyard.com/pricing\">you will pay for this Ferrari.</a> Their slices start at $349.00 a month and incur a $249.00 setup. Take a deep breath and don't pass out. That price comes with a great support staff. It includes some of their time. Remember you have to pay your technical team so you will either pay this to guys in house or to the hosting guys. EngineYard is not the place to go if you are planning on building small web applications. It isn't for you if you and your buddy are building something in your basement. However, if you find you have the next big thing, have the funding and you need help scaling your Rails application so that it can serve millions of people these guys can do it. Expect to purchase 3 slices to really be up and running which means you will be in it more than a $1,000 a month. EngineYard is currently supporting <a href=\"http://www.merbivore.com/\">Merb</a> and <a href=\"http://rubini.us/\">Rubinious</a> and is the host for <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>. I like them I just can't afford them.</p>\n<p>Back to the original point. Morph is a great service. Deployment is simple. I give them lots of points for ease of deployment. They can help you scale as they are using Amazon's services on the back end. However, if they are going to be successful they really need to examine their bandwidth charges and become more competitive. I would like to see their website adapt a bit to make it clear that they offer scalable hosting. At first I was confused and assumed it was only a service provider - something like a hosted CMS system. Overall Morph Exchange is great, but I think they need to make a few changes to become excellent.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-11-morph-exchange-review/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/morph-exchange-review",date:"2008-04-11T06:00:00Z",title:"Morph Exchange Review",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}}],pathPrefix:"archive",first:!1,last:!1,index:17,pageCount:33}}}});
