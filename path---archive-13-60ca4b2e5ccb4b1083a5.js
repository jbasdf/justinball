Twitter is our first evolutionary step towards becoming the the pale faced, laser wearing, funny talking collective that lived in giant boxes. Perhaps the borg have even come back in time and brought us this wondrous technology and destroy our lives.</p>\n<p>Don\'t get me wrong. I love twitter. Never before have so many voices been able to be heard at the same time. However, the negative is that now there are so many voices. Borg thought was shared among all members of the race. At the time the show came out that was a very disturbing scenario. However, social media has changed they way we interact with one another. Now when it is time to <a href="">walk your dog</a>, <a href="">make toast</a>, or attend <a href="">the most conference ever</a> you can let it be known to the collective.</p>\n<p> [3]: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=walk">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=walk</a> the dog\n[4]: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=make">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=make</a> toast\n[5]: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#mwrc">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#mwrc</a></p>\n<p>Of course there is a downside to this. Whenever <a href="">Jean Luc Picard</a> and the brave crew of the enterprise would \'rescue\' someone from the grasp of the borg that individual would feel lonely and miss all the voices in their head. All those power twitter users out there know what this feels like. A few moments or gasp hours away and . When twitter goes down it\'s like that scene in <a href="">Star Wars</a> where <a href="">Obi-wan</a> says "it\'s as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced." A blip in twitter\'s operation shuts everyone up and we all get very lonely so don\'t let that happen.</p>\n<p> [6]: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Jean">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Jean</a> Luc Picard\n[7]: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Star">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Star</a> Wars\n[8]: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Obi-wan">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Obi-wan</a></p>\n<p>If blogs empowered average citizen journalists twitter put us all back up on soap boxes in the park each with one hell of a megaphone. No one need ever be lonely or unheard again. <a href="http://twitter.com/jbasdf">Famous people</a> are on Twitter. <a href="http://twitter.com/jbasdf">Nerds are on twitter</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/jbasdf">Guys that ride bikes are on twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Facebook gave us a way to connect with the friends we already have. Twitter gives us the power to connect with and listen to voices we may never actually meet. The result is a reduction in social friction. I don\'t have to actually meet that <a href="http://twitter.com/d2h">expert ruby on rails programmer</a> to engage in a conversation. Instead I get the opportunity to observe the thoughts and actions of anyone I like or admire (follow) all day every day. That might seem creepy or even pornographic to some, but like the borg I can carry on a conversation with hundreds if not thousands of interesting individuals all at the same time. So next time someone asks you "what is twitter?" Tell them "we are the borg. Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated."</p>\n<p>*Callie used to watch Star Trek Next Generation with me.

They had a great time. At the end of the day we wandered around the area a bit and since there is an Apple store I dropped in to see if they could solve my problem.</p>\n<p>I told my wife it would only be a few minutes. Several hours later a finally got to talk to some high school kid that knew how to turn on the Mac and crop a photo in Photoshop but other than that they were pretty worthless. At least the store looks cool.</p>\n<p>My journey to the Apple store started when I switched my monitory input. I have a 24" Dell monitor and I plug my Macbook Pro into that. As long as I used my DVI to VGA adapter the Macbook Pro would automatically detect when the monitor was plugged in. I figured that since I used my Mac almost exclusively these days I would use the DVI input for the better picture. However, when I started plugging directly into the DVI cable the Macbook Pro no longer recognized when the monitor was plugged in or not plugged in. This is a minor annoyance, but it bugged me so I determined to find a solution which is how I ended up at the Apple store.</p>\n<p>They were no help at all and wasted a lot of my time and my poor wife had to wander around the gateway with the kids while I waited (Of course they couldn\'t let me leave the store and just call my cell. I had to sit there). Did I mentioned that my trip to the Apple store was a total waste?</p>\n<p>I had guessed for a while that it might have something to do with the cable. I being cheap didn\'t want to buy a new one (I know I should have borrowed one) to test. I just assumed that the Apple geeks would know whether or not a cable would matter. They didn\'t.</p>\n<p>It turns out the cable is the issue. So if you find that your Mac doesn\'t automatically recognize the monitor check the cable. It won\'t work with a single link DVI cable, but will work with a dual link DVI cable.</p>\n<p>Here\'s a single link DVI cable. You don\'t want this one:\n<img src="img_4038.jpg" alt="Single Link DVI cable" title="Single Link DVI cable"></p>\n<p>Here\'s a Dual link DVI cable.

I don't really go outside. There are some weeks I don't leave the house. I work at home now. Some days I don't think I actually need a physical body anymore. If I could turn my brain into logical bits I could just live inside the computer. I interact with everyone over IM, Twitter and the phone so no one would really know the difference.</p>\n<p>Kind of sounds like a bad Japanese anime doesn't it?</p>\n<p>I suppose the lack of hands would prevent me from playing board games to for that reason I'll maintain a physical presence. Once the weather warms up I'll need my legs to pedal the bike.</p>\n<p>I have been on the trainer a few times recently. With the amount of code I have to write it is hard to find the time. In spite of an ugly red scar on my knee I don't seem to have any problem riding for an hour at a time (other than sheer boredom from being on the trainer). That is a good sign. I look forward to riding up the local canyons again. I'll try to avoid the various reptilian obstacles that make the road their home.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sarahsample.com/songs.html\">Sarah Sample has a new album out</a>. I really enjoy her music and highly recommend it. She is very talented and her music tends to be inspired by the places she has lived and the people she has interacted with so some of it is about this area. Of course it is about the inspiring parts of Cache Valley not the dirty winters.

Personally I prefer jQuery and the <a href=\"http://ennerchi.com/projects/jrails\">jRails plugin</a> makes the transition simple.  However, there are probably more people using the default libraries.  Prototype actually comes with the ability to create a nice drag and drop ordered tree built in.  However, I don't love the fact that their 'onUpdate' callback doesn't give the node that was dropped.  Instead you are supposed to serialize the entire tree.  awesome<em>nested</em>set makes it very easy to move just one node and that seems more efficient so you'll see a hack in the code below that constantly records the dropped node into a hash table on the 'onChange' event.  That data is then sent to the server on the 'onUpdate' event.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">\nwindow._token = '#{form_authenticity_token}'; // Rails requires this token to validate forms so we'll need to pass it in the ajax request\nwindow._message_updates = new Hash;\nSortable.create('message_tree', {tree:true,\n                                    dropOnEmpty:true,\n                                    scroll:window,\n                                    constraint:false,\n                                    onChange:function(element) {\n                                      // this is a bit of a hack, but basically we just pull the message id from the id of the html element\n                                      var child_id = element.id.replace('message_', '');\n                                      var parent_id = element.up().id.replace('ul_message_', '');\n                                      var previous = element.previous();\n                                      var sibling_id = '';\n                                      if(previous){\n                                        var sibling_id = previous.id.replace('message_', '');\n                                      }\n                                      window._message_updates.set(child_id, [parent_id, sibling_id]);\n                                    },\n                                    onUpdate:function(element) {\n                                      window._message_updates.each(function(pair) {\n                                        var child_id = pair.key;\n                                        var parent_id = pair.value[0];\n                                        var sibling_id = pair.value[1];\n                                        window._message_updates.unset(child_id);\n                                        var url = '/messages/' + child_id + '.js?parent_id=' + parent_id + '&sibling_id=' + sibling_id;\n                                        new Ajax.Request(url, {\n                                          method: 'PUT',\n                                          parameters: {\n                                            authenticity_token: window._token\n                                          }\n                                        });\n                                      });\n                                    }\n                                    });\n</pre></code>\n<p>Here is a link to the default script.aculo.us tree example\n<a href=\"http://script.aculo.us/playground/test/functional/sortable_tree_test.html\">http://script.aculo.us/playground/test/functional/sortable<em>tree</em>test.html</a></p>\n<p>I borrowed many of the ideas from there.
