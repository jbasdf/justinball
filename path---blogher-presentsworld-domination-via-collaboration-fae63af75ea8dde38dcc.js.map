Was started as a site for friends to share sites. They did not start as a business so it was hard for them to become a business.

Users come via their friends that is the point of a social network. It helps if friends bring in friends. You need an “Abraham” a person or people who “begat” other users and shephard them along. You need key players.\\nBefore flickr could setup credit cards they gave away pro accounts to users to give away which made their users look good. Caterina posted on her blog about tea. People made comments. She bought some tea and the company offered a $5 discount to anyone so she got the emails of all the people who posted and emailed them the discount and they loved her.

Those who did not want to participate did not have to.</p>\\n<p>Jenna Woodul – Corporations are starting communities for many reasons – ads, research about customers, support using peer to peer conversation, others want buzz. When you hold a party you can’t just invite people in and leave them. You need leadership to meet and greet. Those individuals need to carry the culture forward. Trust increases when companies interact with users and allow them to interact even if the comments aren’t positive about the company.</p>\\n<p>Jessica Hardwick – Trust within a community. You can’t have a swap transaction without trust that both parties will deliver. Anyone can setup a reputation system. Trust circles or swap circles – people know each other or people know people. Involve users – ask them questions. Users wanted to brand their community. They wanted public and private communities. Reputation is their single most important parameter. People under 18 not allowed. Feedback forms. When launched they built a repuation system. Users asked if they could pull reputation from ebay but they couldn’t. Didn’t like that they were building a closed reputation system. Partnered with rapleaf (<a href=\\\"http://www.rapleaf.com/\\\">http://www.rapleaf.com/</a>).

Communities tend to take on the characteristics of their founders so be sure to invite people of many backgrounds in. It can be hard to moderate communities when there are many cultures.

In those countries certain pictures of women were not acceptable.</p>\\n<p>How do you deal with scale?</p>\\n<p>Jenna Woodul – you have to manage new and veteran users. Hopefully, your community leaders do that. In some communities allowing people to have designations based on time in the community is sometimes helpful depending on the culture.</p>\\n<p>Tools\\nCaterina Fake – build tools that let users expand what you do in ways that you may not currently understand.
