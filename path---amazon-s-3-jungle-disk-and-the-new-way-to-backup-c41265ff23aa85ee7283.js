I feel bad in a way because I still believe that the concept is good. I haven\'t played with the software recently but I am guessing that my voice was loud enough to influence significant change.</p>\n<p>I am fine with that.</p>\n<p>There are a number of other companies that offer similar services. However, at the end of the day I think the simple solution is the one I will go with. In fact I went with it. It took me 15 minutes to setup one night and it now costs me literally pennies to backup my data.</p>\n<p>Step One:\n<a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/index.aspx">Download Jungle Disk</a>. This nice little app makes it simple to send files to S3 and it is cheap - $20.</p>\n<p>Step Two:\n<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Get a key from Amazon</a>. They\'ll want your credit card.</p>\n<p>Step Three:\nTell jungle disk to automatically backup specific files to amazon.</p>\n<p>The cool thing is that Jungle Disk is easy to use and will walk you through getting a key and setting up your backups. It also won\'t fill your temp drive with random crap.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Amazon S3, Jungle Disk and the new way to backup",date:"September 30, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/amazon-s3-jungle-disk-and-the-new-way-to-backup"}}}});
