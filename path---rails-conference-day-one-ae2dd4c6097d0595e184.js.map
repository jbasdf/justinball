This guy likes to blabber on about 'what is scalable' on and on. This is to a room of programmers that already knows what it is to scale. They want to know how to scale. Don't waste our time.</p>\\n<p>The talk started to get better. He started showing real numbers and explain real ideas. However, I still left and headed over to Test Driven Development. I thought I might be behind but he has been going over basic stuff so I should still be good.</p>\\n<p>So I wandered around to the Test Driven Development and the Scriptaculous sessions. They were a little to beginner so I am back in the scalability session.</p>\\n<p>It has gotten good. He is providing real data.\\nThey use Big IP load balancers because they are the only ones that can provide the throughput they want.\\nThe bottle neck in a rails app is not rails it is the load balancer.\\nThey divided up their app into app servers. One app does email, one does rss, one does calendar etc. They use layer 7 (Big IP) load balancers to divide up the traffic to the app servers. It looks like one app, but the requests go to different servers.\\nVarnish is the best open source Load Balancer\\nNginx for static content serving on Solaris\\nThey get away from using a relational DB - what data can be moved out. In many cases you don't need a RDMS.\\nMemcache\\nLDAP - use this a lot. Using Sun Directory Server (open source)\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.process-one.net/en/jeai/\\\">J-EAI</a> (message bus with an in memory db) use this to manage db reads and writes. You can program the bus and tell it to read and write at given intervals. Written in erlang. You can put all your data into the base. This includes email, atom, rss etc. It scales. It connects to all kinds of apps. They are going to release to the world.\\nFile system - put some stuff on the file system.
