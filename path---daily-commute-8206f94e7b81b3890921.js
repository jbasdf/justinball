Since riding a mountain bike on the road is like only your SUV to pick up the kids and buy groceries (welcome to America), I needed some time off road with my sexy Blur XC. We went up the River Trail. I love that ride. The part from first dam to the trail head (on the road) sucks. It is made worse by the wind from Logan canyon that blows like a hurricane in the morning. However, once you get past that the River Trail is worth every bit of the pain you endure to get there. To me the River Trail is less about hard core biking and more about enjoying the nature that is so close to Logan. It is also almost like a local social event. You share the trial with other bikers, hikers, joggers, and fisherman. Everyone I have come across thus far has been extremely courteous. I have started seeing the same people on the trail. The River Trail is like a party every morning. It is great.</p>\n<p>At First Dam comes the next part of the commute. In order to stay in the dirt we follow the deer fence trail to Green Canyon. This trail hugs the side of the mountains and offers an incredible view of the entire valley. Rather than build their homes high up on the hill people need to get on their bikes. For no money at all you can have the best view in the valley every morning.</p>\n<p>But you pay for the view with pain.</p>\n<p>The climb from First Dam up includes sections with 25% grade. I am not exaggerating. I measured it with my Polar CS600 this morning. Your brain tells you that you are going to fall over backwards and your legs tell you that you are a moron. It is great fun.</p>\n<p>I am hoping to incorporate more of the local trails in my commute tonight.</p>\n<p>Cache Valley is a great place to live.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Daily Commute",date:"August 10, 2007",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/daily-commute"}}}});
