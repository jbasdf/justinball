It's an honor that I doubt very many people love since it\nmeans someone close to you has passed away.</p>\n<p>A week ago my Aunt Dawn was driving back from Arco. In a tragic bit of bad luck a freak snow storm made the road slick.\nHer car hit a patch of ice and an oncoming car crashed into the side of her vehicle. Luckily, the people in the other car walked away.</p>\n<p>I learned a few new things about my Aunt and was reminded of a few things I had forgotten. She lived a life of service. She loved little kids.\nShe also carried a loaded 357 magnum in her car and even slept with it under her pillow.\nShe and her sisters, my mother included, did everything together. She was my grandmother's caretaker in many ways,\nbut really she was her best friend. The void she leaves can't be filled. I regret that I always took it for granted\nthat Dawn would always be there. I think that we forget that life is a temporary state. Sadly, the people around\nus won't always be there. This is cliche but in our climate where there is so much focus on work and consumerism,\nspend time with the people you love.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Aunt Dawn",date:"April 09, 2009",image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/aunt-dawn"}}}});
