It wasn't, but there are still a few bugs. They are probably my fault, but I think there is a great opportunity to integrate this software into ecommerce sites like mine to provide customers a really cool method for quickly browsing product. It works especially well with <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com/house-plans\\\">house plans</a>. (Follow the link. If you have PicLens installed you can press the little blue play button in the upper right of your browser. If not click on the 'View as Slideshow' link).</p>\\n<p>Here are a couple of things I would love to see them add/change. I noticed that in the flash slide show the player pulls in the 'description' field from the RSS but the Firefox Extension does not. We added a bunch of info about each house plan into that field so it helps our users get more information about the plan as they are viewing the slideshow.</p>\\n<p>It would be nice if there was a more obvious way to click through to view the web page of the image you are viewing. Right now you can click on the title and it will take you, but that took me a minute to figure out and I am betting my users won't know to do that.</p>\\n<p>I followed the advanced integration tutorial and added paging to my atom and rss feeds but as far as I can tell the only images you can view are the ones on the current page. I would love to be able to view all 18,000 plans in the viewer. I messed up on my RSS feed. The paging works great.</p>\\n<p>Now I am off to show this off to my wife. It looks pretty. Nobody cares when I spend a week getting a database schema just right, but when I build something that looks pretty I get praise.

After months of deliberating size, components and Project One or stock I walked into the shop this morning and put my money down on a Madone 6.9. Yesterday by total chance I was in Ogden and so was the Trek demo team. They helped me get setup on with the right size which is one of the things that has held me back so far. I really wanted to get SRAM Red on the bike, but I have heard from a few people that it still has some bugs. It would probably work fine for me, but I know that Dura Ace is a great group and will run just fine. </p>\\n<p>A couple of things turned me to the stock bike instead of a Project One. There are currently 3 stock 6.9s at Trek. I managed to get one so my bike will be here in 7 days. Project One was going to take anywhere from 5 weeks to 2 months. I can wait that long, but I have to really want to. I love the paint job on the stock bike so the only reason I was going with Project One was the Red Grouppo. The Trek rep and a couple of other guys convinced me that for the money the Dura Ace group would be just as good and with the stock bike I end up with the Race XXX Lite wheels instead of the Race X Lite wheels.</p>\\n<p>The biggest disappointment on this bike is the crankset. On a $7700 bike you'd think they could do better than a Race X Lite crank. When you spend that much it also seems like they could let you change a few things - I will have to get rid of the stock stem and buy another one to get the right fit.</p>\\n<p>I will write a full review with pictures when the bike comes.

For a while I was tempted to go with the 5.2, but why be responsible when you can spend an insane amount of money to shave a pound off your bike? This morning I went to Thanksgiving Point to an Apple Educator Conference. We were just a few miles from the Trek store, but I didn't feel right using a University car to engage in my hobbies so we didn't go. When I got home my wife mentioned that she needed to run some errands in Ogden and when should we go? I knew there was a shop in that area that had a couple of Madones so I figure I can endure fabric stores for a visit to the bike shop. </p>\\n<p>It was totally worth the effort. I walk in the door of the shop and start chatting with guys. They tell me that Trek just so happens to be in town doing test rides. I get my butt up to the Weber State Stadium (location of said test rides) as fast as I can. Sure enough they had several Madones and I was able to spend time figuring out the right size. They swapped stems and frames. I wish I would have know they would be there. I would have taken my bike clothes and shoes. At any rate, we figured out that the 58\\\" is a better fit. I used a 90mm stem with a 17 degree rise. I wonder if a 12 degree wouldn't be better, but I might not find a Bontrager stem with those specs. That is fine.</p>\\n<p>I was pretty sure I was going to do a Project One so that I could get a SRAM Red groupset. The guys around here lean that way. The guys at the shop down there and the Trek rep both said that for the money they would go with the stock bike. The price works out such that I can do a stock Trek 6.9 and get Race XXX Lite wheels or do a Project One with Race X Lite but get the Red Group. It is a hard call. Maybe it shouldn't be. I still don't know what to do. I don't want 2008 to be over before I get a new bike. I really wish I could get the new Dura Ace 7900 but we won't see that until September which means it won't ship until next spring.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-17-2008-trek-madone-dilema/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/2008-trek-madone-dilema\",\"date\":\"2008-04-17T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"2008 Trek Madone Dilema\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Cycling\",\"2008\",\"6.9\",\"madone\",\"project one\",\"trek\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I recently wrote about Cloud Computing.

I said I would check it out. He said he would hold me to it. Last night I spent a little quality with Morph and now have a few impressions to share.</p>\\n<p>First, adding your application to Morph is a bit confusing. It is setup as an 'application exchange' so instead of signing up for hosting you 'subscribe' to the Morph DevCenter. Once you do that you create a new 'Appspace'. Once you get past the oddity of how to get going the next part is very easy. You click one button to create the database. Then you click another to download a Capistrano file. By default it is named morph_deploy.rb but I renamed mine to just deploy so I don't have to tell Capistrano the name of the file every time I want to deploy. Add the deploy.rb to your project, edit it and set your subversion repository, do a cap deploy:morph, enter your username and password and you are ready to go. In just a few minutes your application is up and running on Morph Exchange. At first I was confused about the database. I couldn't figure out what values I should be setting in my database.yml file, but then I realized that Morph takes care of that for you. You never set the production settings for your database you just do the deploy and go. Also, it is important to note that your database migrations must be compatible with PostGreSQL. </p>\\n<p>Morph Exhange gives you a developer account for free. That includes 1GB worth of storage and 1GB worth of transfer. I found it difficult to find <a href=\\\"http://www.morphexchange.com/map_info#pricing\\\">pricing on the site</a>. It is a bit hidden. You'll find it under DevCenter then select the pricing tab. The cost of the service isn't bad. The developer account is free. One step up is $31 a month. (Morph Exchange uses 'Morph Credits' but one credit = one dollar). The pricing goes up from there all the way to $1023 a month. The pricing didn't seem to bad until I really spent time thinking about it. The $1023 a month service comes with 250GB of storage and 250GB of bandwidth. The bandwidth is the shop stopper for me. The <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com\\\" title=\\\"house plans and architectural information from The Plan Collection\\\">ThePlancollection.com</a> is not a huge ecommerce site but still burns around 300GB of bandwidth a month. Morph Exchange would not be a good option if you are planning on serving a lot of data to a lot of people which makes me wonder if it is a good option. The point of cloud computing is the ability to scale which means you will serve out a lot of data. In Morph terms that means a lot of money. On the lower end for $93 a month you get 15GB of bandwidth. This blog doesn't get a whole lot of traffic but I am pretty sure I serve that much data per month. If it cost me $93 a month I wouldn't be blogging. </p>\\n<p>For comparison Joyent will let you serve 10TB of data a month even if you are only using their $45 a month plan. I know that you won't be able to serve that much data from a $45 a month account - you will overwhelm the server long before you hit that limit - but what they are saying is we don't care how much you serve. Instead they are focusing on helping you scale up your CPU resources to meet customer demand. That seems like a more reasonable model.</p>\\n<p>Mosso has an interesting model as well. Their plan starts at $100 a month. They don't measure your output in bandwidth but in requests. For $100 you get 3 million requests. After that it costs 3¢ per 1,000 requests. I don't care for that model either. I would rather spend my days worrying about providing enough CPU power to keep my app responsive for my customers and not worrying about how many requests my customers are making. Services like this actually encourage the provider to find ways to serve less items to their customers. You start re-architecting your application so that it won't serve as many items at a time. Remember that each file and each image is a new request so your best be here is to reduce images, css files and javascript files. You don't get ssh access to Mosso either which can be good and bad depending on how deeply involved you want to be with your hosting company. It also makes you feel like you have to chase away the free loaders like some grouchy old shop keeper - don't come look at my products unless you intend to buy.</p>\\n<p>Since I am wearing my EngineYard shirt today I'll throw them into the mix. I consider these guys to be the Ferrari of Ruby on Rails hosting. They were at the Mountain West Ruby conference. I spent some time eavesdropping while hanging out in their suite at the hotel. These guys are as core to the future of Rails as 37 Signals. They know what they are doing. However, <a href=\\\"http://www.engineyard.com/pricing\\\">you will pay for this Ferrari.</a> Their slices start at $349.00 a month and incur a $249.00 setup. Take a deep breath and don't pass out. That price comes with a great support staff. It includes some of their time. Remember you have to pay your technical team so you will either pay this to guys in house or to the hosting guys. EngineYard is not the place to go if you are planning on building small web applications. It isn't for you if you and your buddy are building something in your basement. However, if you find you have the next big thing, have the funding and you need help scaling your Rails application so that it can serve millions of people these guys can do it. Expect to purchase 3 slices to really be up and running which means you will be in it more than a $1,000 a month. EngineYard is currently supporting <a href=\\\"http://www.merbivore.com/\\\">Merb</a> and <a href=\\\"http://rubini.us/\\\">Rubinious</a> and is the host for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/\\\">GitHub</a>. I like them I just can't afford them.</p>\\n<p>Back to the original point. Morph is a great service. Deployment is simple. I give them lots of points for ease of deployment. They can help you scale as they are using Amazon's services on the back end. However, if they are going to be successful they really need to examine their bandwidth charges and become more competitive. I would like to see their website adapt a bit to make it clear that they offer scalable hosting. At first I was confused and assumed it was only a service provider - something like a hosted CMS system. Overall Morph Exchange is great, but I think they need to make a few changes to become excellent.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-11-morph-exchange-review/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/morph-exchange-review\",\"date\":\"2008-04-11T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Morph Exchange Review\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"internet\",\"Programming\",\"cloud computing\",\"engine yard\",\"hosting\",\"joyent\",\"morph exchange\",\"mosso\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"My buddies at work find bacon chocolate chip cookies .

Almost any day of the week he can be seen riding his bike around town. He has a horn on it that he honks and he waves at every passerby. He is always happy and every time I see him not matter how crappy my day has been I have to wave back. This one individual brightens up the entire community.</p>\\n<p>When the Olympics came to Utah the torch relay came through Logan. It wasn't the mayor, or the university president or some CEO that carried the torch on its arrival. Instead, to the cheer of thousands of onlookers the torch was carried in by Brent Carpenter. They couldn't have picked a better person. As far as I am concerned he does more for the well being and happiness of the community each day than most of our leaders combined.</p>\\n<p>I contrast this event with the torch relay this year. Rather than being an inspirational event that brings people together <a href=\\\"http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/olympic_torch_used_to\\\">it has become a symbol of human rights violations</a>. (Yes, I know its the onion). World leaders are being encouraged to boycott the opening ceremony. A while back I heard that athletes were being asked to boycott as well. I can't imagine anything more unfair to those who sacrifice a great deal and only get a few chances to display their talents to the world. If a point was to be made it should have been made by the Olympic Committee. They selected China knowing China's human rights record. Don't ask the athletes to sacrifice now because of the committee's poor choices.</p>\\n<p>However, having said that on the way home today I was listening to NPR. The newscasters were interviewing a Canadian government employee in charge of business relations with China. They are headed to meet with Chinese officials this next week to discuss trade. All during the conversation the newscasters would bait the individual with questions relating to China and human rights. Each time the person would respond with \\\"We aren't in charge of such matters. The federal government sets policy and it is not our job to engage in diplomatic relations regarding anything outside the scope of business development.\\\" I don't blame the individual for the statement. I think that is the attitude most of us share. We like to be able to purchase cheap stuff. Walmart has made it easy for us to consume large quantities of items from China. Our lifestyle now depends on cheap exports from the far east. We now share an unhealthy, symbiotic relationship relationship with China. They ensure we have a comfortable and cheap lifestyle and we give them lots of money. Our trade deficit with China runs about one billion dollars a day.</p>\\n<p>Do the sins of the Chinese government bleed onto our hands? I don't know. We provide a powerful economic engine via the dollars we vote with. We love democracy and freedom. I don't think any good American would ever think or say that it is a good thing for China to occupy Tibet or imprison political dissidents but it is easy to silence our values with <a href=\\\"http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=130306\\\">rollback savings</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-09-happy-smiley-guy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/happy-smiley-guy\",\"date\":\"2008-04-09T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Happy Smiley Guy\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Cycling\",\"Cycling\",\"democray\",\"happy\",\"human rights\",\"olympic torch\",\"olympics\",\"optimism\",\"values\",\"walmart\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"My daughters are in kindergarten this year.

Moving hosts later on is terribly difficult so choosing the correct hosting company is as important as selecting a business partner. <a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us/jbasdf/hosting\\\">I've collected about 30 hosting companies in my delicious bookmarks</a>. Some are specific to a platform others are really cheap. I recorded them because they looked interesting.</p>\\n<p>The latest movement in web hosting is towards cloud hosting. This is the holy grail for the user and for the hosting company. Imagine a web host that scales as you grow. Everyone would love nothing more than a host that could handle getting slammed by Digg.</p>\\n<p>Amazon's ec2 service offers scalable services, but it is not a simple as your typical web hosting company. <a href=\\\"http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/\\\">The Ruby gem ec2onrails</a> will simplify the process of getting your Ruby on Rails application up an running. <a href=\\\"http://www.rightscale.com/m/\\\">RightScale</a> builds on ec2 to make it easy to deploy your application. They add a dashboard and make it easy to load balance and bring up new instances. However, at a starting price of $500 a month and a $2500 setup fee they aren't cheap. <a href=\\\"http://www.elastra.com/\\\">Elastra</a> is another cloud computing service. They claim to not have setup fees, but I can't find a price on their site. The real advantage to these services beyond scaling really needs to be cost. Paying for what you use can be great, but can also be a bit scary. If you site takes off all of a sudden you might get stuck with a rather large bill, but hey at least your server didn't go down.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.mosso.com/\\\">Mosso</a> has the ability to let you host linux or windows. At $100 a month their price is reasonable and they can scale up depending on how many requests you make. <a href=\\\"http://www.3tera.com/\\\">3Tera</a> claims they can 'scale from a fraction of a server to hundreds of CPUs in days'. They also claim that you won't need to change your application code.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http://www.bluehost.com\\\">Bluehost.com</a> hosting space ($6-$7) isn't going away anytime soon. However, the future of scalable applications I think lies with cloud computing.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\\\"http://eedious.blogspot.com/\\\">Alain Benedict</a> I am adding <a href=\\\"http://morphexchange.com/\\\">Morph</a> to the list of services. I haven't had time to really examine the service yet, but it looks like it removes a lot of the hassle of hosting a Rails application.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-08-elastic-cloud-computing/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/elastic-cloud-computing\",\"date\":\"2008-04-08T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Elastic Cloud Computing\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"hosting\",\"internet\",\"Programming\",\"Projects\",\"Ruby On Rails\",\"3tera\",\"cloud computing\",\"ec2\",\"elastra\",\"mosso\",\"rightscale\",\"ruby_on_rails\",\"scalability\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"There is a lot of buzz on the BuddyPress mailing list now that there is a list.

I could be wrong, but to me a fence says this is mine, that is yours, stay the hell out.</p>\\n<p>I think that businesses build fences. I noticed it today when I was at Albertson's (grocery store). They have a deal that requires you to buy 20 items from a certain list of participating items. I hit the 'fence' after I selected 20 items. I would have added more but wasn't sure if that meant I had to buy another 20 items to get the deal. Since I only wanted 3 or 4 more items not another 20 I stopped at 20. The business failed to communicate and in effect fenced me off from purchasing more items.</p>\\n<p>Websites have fences as well. It is very easy to make navigation so difficult that some of your content is effectively fenced off from the rest of the website. I frequently feel that way when I browse a site.

It wasn't, but there are still a few bugs. They are probably my fault, but I think there is a great opportunity to integrate this software into ecommerce sites like mine to provide customers a really cool method for quickly browsing product. It works especially well with <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com/house-plans\\\">house plans</a>. (Follow the link. If you have PicLens installed you can press the little blue play button in the upper right of your browser. If not click on the 'View as Slideshow' link).</p>\\n<p>Here are a couple of things I would love to see them add/change. I noticed that in the flash slide show the player pulls in the 'description' field from the RSS but the Firefox Extension does not. We added a bunch of info about each house plan into that field so it helps our users get more information about the plan as they are viewing the slideshow.</p>\\n<p>It would be nice if there was a more obvious way to click through to view the web page of the image you are viewing. Right now you can click on the title and it will take you, but that took me a minute to figure out and I am betting my users won't know to do that.</p>\\n<p>I followed the advanced integration tutorial and added paging to my atom and rss feeds but as far as I can tell the only images you can view are the ones on the current page. I would love to be able to view all 18,000 plans in the viewer. I messed up on my RSS feed. The paging works great.</p>\\n<p>Now I am off to show this off to my wife. It looks pretty.

Yesterday by total chance I was in Ogden and so was the Trek demo team. They helped me get setup on with the right size which is one of the things that has held me back so far. I really wanted to get SRAM Red on the bike, but I have heard from a few people that it still has some bugs. It would probably work fine for me, but I know that Dura Ace is a great group and will run just fine. </p>\\n<p>A couple of things turned me to the stock bike instead of a Project One. There are currently 3 stock 6.9s at Trek. I managed to get one so my bike will be here in 7 days. Project One was going to take anywhere from 5 weeks to 2 months. I can wait that long, but I have to really want to. I love the paint job on the stock bike so the only reason I was going with Project One was the Red Grouppo. The Trek rep and a couple of other guys convinced me that for the money the Dura Ace group would be just as good and with the stock bike I end up with the Race XXX Lite wheels instead of the Race X Lite wheels.</p>\\n<p>The biggest disappointment on this bike is the crankset. On a $7700 bike you'd think they could do better than a Race X Lite crank. When you spend that much it also seems like they could let you change a few things - I will have to get rid of the stock stem and buy another one to get the right fit.</p>\\n<p>I will write a full review with pictures when the bike comes. I have never been so happy to spend so much.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-18-bought-the-trek-madone-69/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/bought-the-trek-madone-69\",\"date\":\"2008-04-18T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Bought the Trek Madone 6.9\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Cycling\",\"2008 Trek Madone\",\"6.9\",\"Cycling\",\"madone\",\"trek\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I have waited a year now to buy the perfect bike.

For a while I was tempted to go with the 5.2, but why be responsible when you can spend an insane amount of money to shave a pound off your bike? This morning I went to Thanksgiving Point to an Apple Educator Conference. We were just a few miles from the Trek store, but I didn't feel right using a University car to engage in my hobbies so we didn't go. When I got home my wife mentioned that she needed to run some errands in Ogden and when should we go? I knew there was a shop in that area that had a couple of Madones so I figure I can endure fabric stores for a visit to the bike shop. </p>\\n<p>It was totally worth the effort. I walk in the door of the shop and start chatting with guys. They tell me that Trek just so happens to be in town doing test rides. I get my butt up to the Weber State Stadium (location of said test rides) as fast as I can. Sure enough they had several Madones and I was able to spend time figuring out the right size. They swapped stems and frames. I wish I would have know they would be there. I would have taken my bike clothes and shoes. At any rate, we figured out that the 58\\\" is a better fit. I used a 90mm stem with a 17 degree rise. I wonder if a 12 degree wouldn't be better, but I might not find a Bontrager stem with those specs. That is fine.</p>\\n<p>I was pretty sure I was going to do a Project One so that I could get a SRAM Red groupset. The guys around here lean that way. The guys at the shop down there and the Trek rep both said that for the money they would go with the stock bike. The price works out such that I can do a stock Trek 6.9 and get Race XXX Lite wheels or do a Project One with Race X Lite but get the Red Group. It is a hard call. Maybe it shouldn't be. I still don't know what to do. I don't want 2008 to be over before I get a new bike. I really wish I could get the new Dura Ace 7900 but we won't see that until September which means it won't ship until next spring.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-17-2008-trek-madone-dilema/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/2008-trek-madone-dilema\",\"date\":\"2008-04-17T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"2008 Trek Madone Dilema\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Cycling\",\"2008\",\"6.9\",\"madone\",\"project one\",\"trek\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I recently wrote about Cloud Computing.

I said I would check it out. He said he would hold me to it. Last night I spent a little quality with Morph and now have a few impressions to share.</p>\\n<p>First, adding your application to Morph is a bit confusing. It is setup as an 'application exchange' so instead of signing up for hosting you 'subscribe' to the Morph DevCenter. Once you do that you create a new 'Appspace'. Once you get past the oddity of how to get going the next part is very easy. You click one button to create the database. Then you click another to download a Capistrano file. By default it is named morph_deploy.rb but I renamed mine to just deploy so I don't have to tell Capistrano the name of the file every time I want to deploy. Add the deploy.rb to your project, edit it and set your subversion repository, do a cap deploy:morph, enter your username and password and you are ready to go. In just a few minutes your application is up and running on Morph Exchange. At first I was confused about the database. I couldn't figure out what values I should be setting in my database.yml file, but then I realized that Morph takes care of that for you. You never set the production settings for your database you just do the deploy and go. Also, it is important to note that your database migrations must be compatible with PostGreSQL. </p>\\n<p>Morph Exhange gives you a developer account for free. That includes 1GB worth of storage and 1GB worth of transfer. I found it difficult to find <a href=\\\"http://www.morphexchange.com/map_info#pricing\\\">pricing on the site</a>. It is a bit hidden. You'll find it under DevCenter then select the pricing tab. The cost of the service isn't bad. The developer account is free. One step up is $31 a month. (Morph Exchange uses 'Morph Credits' but one credit = one dollar). The pricing goes up from there all the way to $1023 a month. The pricing didn't seem to bad until I really spent time thinking about it. The $1023 a month service comes with 250GB of storage and 250GB of bandwidth. The bandwidth is the shop stopper for me. The <a href=\\\"http://www.theplancollection.com\\\" title=\\\"house plans and architectural information from The Plan Collection\\\">ThePlancollection.com</a> is not a huge ecommerce site but still burns around 300GB of bandwidth a month. Morph Exchange would not be a good option if you are planning on serving a lot of data to a lot of people which makes me wonder if it is a good option. The point of cloud computing is the ability to scale which means you will serve out a lot of data. In Morph terms that means a lot of money. On the lower end for $93 a month you get 15GB of bandwidth. This blog doesn't get a whole lot of traffic but I am pretty sure I serve that much data per month. If it cost me $93 a month I wouldn't be blogging. </p>\\n<p>For comparison Joyent will let you serve 10TB of data a month even if you are only using their $45 a month plan. I know that you won't be able to serve that much data from a $45 a month account - you will overwhelm the server long before you hit that limit - but what they are saying is we don't care how much you serve. Instead they are focusing on helping you scale up your CPU resources to meet customer demand. That seems like a more reasonable model.</p>\\n<p>Mosso has an interesting model as well. Their plan starts at $100 a month. They don't measure your output in bandwidth but in requests. For $100 you get 3 million requests. After that it costs 3¢ per 1,000 requests. I don't care for that model either. I would rather spend my days worrying about providing enough CPU power to keep my app responsive for my customers and not worrying about how many requests my customers are making. Services like this actually encourage the provider to find ways to serve less items to their customers. You start re-architecting your application so that it won't serve as many items at a time. Remember that each file and each image is a new request so your best be here is to reduce images, css files and javascript files. You don't get ssh access to Mosso either which can be good and bad depending on how deeply involved you want to be with your hosting company. It also makes you feel like you have to chase away the free loaders like some grouchy old shop keeper - don't come look at my products unless you intend to buy.</p>\\n<p>Since I am wearing my EngineYard shirt today I'll throw them into the mix. I consider these guys to be the Ferrari of Ruby on Rails hosting. They were at the Mountain West Ruby conference. I spent some time eavesdropping while hanging out in their suite at the hotel. These guys are as core to the future of Rails as 37 Signals. They know what they are doing. However, <a href=\\\"http://www.engineyard.com/pricing\\\">you will pay for this Ferrari.</a> Their slices start at $349.00 a month and incur a $249.00 setup. Take a deep breath and don't pass out. That price comes with a great support staff. It includes some of their time. Remember you have to pay your technical team so you will either pay this to guys in house or to the hosting guys. EngineYard is not the place to go if you are planning on building small web applications. It isn't for you if you and your buddy are building something in your basement. However, if you find you have the next big thing, have the funding and you need help scaling your Rails application so that it can serve millions of people these guys can do it. Expect to purchase 3 slices to really be up and running which means you will be in it more than a $1,000 a month. EngineYard is currently supporting <a href=\\\"http://www.merbivore.com/\\\">Merb</a> and <a href=\\\"http://rubini.us/\\\">Rubinious</a> and is the host for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/\\\">GitHub</a>. I like them I just can't afford them.</p>\\n<p>Back to the original point. Morph is a great service. Deployment is simple. I give them lots of points for ease of deployment. They can help you scale as they are using Amazon's services on the back end. However, if they are going to be successful they really need to examine their bandwidth charges and become more competitive. I would like to see their website adapt a bit to make it clear that they offer scalable hosting. At first I was confused and assumed it was only a service provider - something like a hosted CMS system. Overall Morph Exchange is great, but I think they need to make a few changes to become excellent.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-11-morph-exchange-review/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/morph-exchange-review\",\"date\":\"2008-04-11T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Morph Exchange Review\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"internet\",\"Programming\",\"cloud computing\",\"engine yard\",\"hosting\",\"joyent\",\"morph exchange\",\"mosso\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"My buddies at work find bacon chocolate chip cookies .

Almost any day of the week he can be seen riding his bike around town. He has a horn on it that he honks and he waves at every passerby. He is always happy and every time I see him not matter how crappy my day has been I have to wave back. This one individual brightens up the entire community.</p>\\n<p>When the Olympics came to Utah the torch relay came through Logan. It wasn't the mayor, or the university president or some CEO that carried the torch on its arrival. Instead, to the cheer of thousands of onlookers the torch was carried in by Brent Carpenter. They couldn't have picked a better person. As far as I am concerned he does more for the well being and happiness of the community each day than most of our leaders combined.</p>\\n<p>I contrast this event with the torch relay this year. Rather than being an inspirational event that brings people together <a href=\\\"http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/olympic_torch_used_to\\\">it has become a symbol of human rights violations</a>. (Yes, I know its the onion). World leaders are being encouraged to boycott the opening ceremony. A while back I heard that athletes were being asked to boycott as well. I can't imagine anything more unfair to those who sacrifice a great deal and only get a few chances to display their talents to the world. If a point was to be made it should have been made by the Olympic Committee. They selected China knowing China's human rights record. Don't ask the athletes to sacrifice now because of the committee's poor choices.</p>\\n<p>However, having said that on the way home today I was listening to NPR. The newscasters were interviewing a Canadian government employee in charge of business relations with China. They are headed to meet with Chinese officials this next week to discuss trade. All during the conversation the newscasters would bait the individual with questions relating to China and human rights. Each time the person would respond with \\\"We aren't in charge of such matters. The federal government sets policy and it is not our job to engage in diplomatic relations regarding anything outside the scope of business development.\\\" I don't blame the individual for the statement. I think that is the attitude most of us share. We like to be able to purchase cheap stuff. Walmart has made it easy for us to consume large quantities of items from China. Our lifestyle now depends on cheap exports from the far east. We now share an unhealthy, symbiotic relationship relationship with China. They ensure we have a comfortable and cheap lifestyle and we give them lots of money. Our trade deficit with China runs about one billion dollars a day.</p>\\n<p>Do the sins of the Chinese government bleed onto our hands? I don't know. We provide a powerful economic engine via the dollars we vote with. We love democracy and freedom. I don't think any good American would ever think or say that it is a good thing for China to occupy Tibet or imprison political dissidents but it is easy to silence our values with <a href=\\\"http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=130306\\\">rollback savings</a>.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-09-happy-smiley-guy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/happy-smiley-guy\",\"date\":\"2008-04-09T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Happy Smiley Guy\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"Cycling\",\"Cycling\",\"democray\",\"happy\",\"human rights\",\"olympic torch\",\"olympics\",\"optimism\",\"values\",\"walmart\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"My daughters are in kindergarten this year.

This is the holy grail for the user and for the hosting company. Imagine a web host that scales as you grow. Everyone would love nothing more than a host that could handle getting slammed by Digg.</p>\\n<p>Amazon's ec2 service offers scalable services, but it is not a simple as your typical web hosting company. <a href=\\\"http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/\\\">The Ruby gem ec2onrails</a> will simplify the process of getting your Ruby on Rails application up an running. <a href=\\\"http://www.rightscale.com/m/\\\">RightScale</a> builds on ec2 to make it easy to deploy your application.

They claim to not have setup fees, but I can't find a price on their site. The real advantage to these services beyond scaling really needs to be cost.

It seems to be true in some cases, but perhaps not in others. I am not sure I would trust private parties to fund things like the National Science Foundation or the National Endowment for the Humanities. Governments tend to ensure funding for things that markets don't support because the en devour lacks sustainability or is to expensive/risky for an entrepreneur to take on. On the other hand few people would argue that government could ever touch the efficiency of private business.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-01-walmart-is-not-so-evil/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/walmart-is-not-so-evil\",\"date\":\"2008-04-01T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Walmart is Not so Evil\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"tags\":[\"business\",\"economy\",\"business\",\"economy\",\"government\",\"walmart\"],\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I spent two years in Japan.

I thought I was a pretty good player. I used to be able to beat most casual players I met. He slaughtered me in about 10 moves. I kind of expected that. It was the most elegant butt kicking I have ever received. Grand masters think different than the rest of us. I don't remember how he beat me, but I do remember that it was smooth, quick and brutal.</p>\\n<p>This weekend I spent time with the Ruby Grand Masters. In my opinion there isn't a better Ruby conference than the Mountain West Ruby conference. The hackers show up. These guys are all about being the very best - not for money but for love of the language. Here's a list of the guys I could gather up. I am sure there were many others who didn't present who should also make this list:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://blog.fallingsnow.net/\\\">Evan Phoenix</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.confreaks.com/videos/90-mwrc2008-strengthening-the-ruby-ecosystem-part-i-rubinius\\\">Strengthening the Ruby Ecosystem</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://brainspl.at/\\\">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.confreaks.com/videos/817-mwrc2008-strengthening-the-ruby-ecosystem-part-ii-merb\\\">Merb Presentation</a> <a href=\\\"http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/03/29/mountain-west-rubyconf-merb-slides\\\">Merb Slides</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/\\\">Giles Bowkett</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/\\\">Patrick Farley</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://onestepback.org/\\\">Jim Weirich</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://ph7spot.com/\\\">Philippe Hanrigou</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.yehudakatz.com/\\\">Yehuda Katz</a> <a href=\\\"http://datamapper.org/\\\">DataMapper</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.jeremymcanally.com/\\\">Jeremy McAnally</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://objo.com/\\\">Joe O'Brien</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://tammersaleh.com/\\\">Tammer Saleh\\n</a><a href=\\\"http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda\\\">Shoulda Testing Framework</a>.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.daikini.com/\\\" title=\\\"[Conference videos can be found here.][19]\\\">Jonathan Younger</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://jan.prima.de/\\\">Jan Lehnardt</a> gets added for <a href=\\\"http://couchdb.org\\\">CouchDB </a> even though it isn't technically Ruby.</p>\\n<p>The presentations were about learning to think differently about Ruby and how to really take advantage of the elegance of the language.
