At least all the doctors and nurses I have run into have been kind and helpful. However, as I sit here tonight I have 7 probes attached to my body and they itch like hell. On one of my recent rides to the stop of Smithfield Canyon I pegged my heart rate and couldn't get it back down as quickly as I would have liked to. My legs were great, but my heart just wasn't up to it. I was seeing around 190-199 beats per minute and after the ride noticed a max of 211. My chest actually hurt and I could feel my heart jarring the rest of my body. I wasn't about to stop so I finished and at the top I almost puked. Fun stuff.\nMy back has been hurting so I go see the doctor. I figure since I am there I will ask him lots of cycling questions and ask about my heart. He is helpful and answers all my questions and gives me good advice (he is a hard core cyclist). Then he sends me off to get xrays for my back and to get a heart probe - thus the stupid electrodes taped to my chest.</p>\n<p>This is the part that sucks. For all the money this is going to cost me I end up with a piece of crap technology, tape all over me, a partially shaved chest, and a constant burning sensation on my skin that makes me wish I could tear all the hair right off my body.</p>\n<p>I go in today and am helped by a very nice young lady. She is a college student. I imagine they pay her 7 or 8 bucks an hour. When I get the bill I bet it will be 60 or more and hour. She tells me that she has to shave parts of my chest to stick on these stupid probes and that I have to wear the thing for 24 hours. She then takes a dry razor and runs it across my chest. Now if you are paying 60 bucks an hour or even 60 bucks to go to a barber to get your face shaved you will get a sweet deal. They will use an old world brush and very carefully remove the hair from your face. Go to the hospital pay more and you get some college kid running a cheap disposable razor across your body leaving a rash that makes 2nd degree burns look enjoyable. Now you'd think that with all that hair they would have you stand up, shake it off - remove it somehow. Nope they just tape it right on there. Ever had a hair cut and had some of the hair slip down your back? Ever have a barber tape all that hair onto you? You would never return to a place with service like this, but we accept this Soviet era world because hey its medicine and that's just how it is right? Lame.</p>\n<p>Next she tapes 7 probes to my chest but only after running sand paper over my freshly shaved chest. (I'm sure that stuff costs 20 bucks and is no different then what you buy at Home Depot). This does not feel good. Then they stick probes on you that have salt in them. I know it helps conduct signals, bla bla, but I am pretty sure this method was originally devised as a torture device. She then attached a bunch of wires that look like something directly from my Electrical Engineering labs. They are thick and long and she has to then tape those all over my chest - shaven and unshaven parts this time which is stupid since the tape just sticks to the hair and pulls it right out then the tape isn't stuck to anything and is free to roam around inside your clothes like those little black beetle things in The Mummy. After that I am forced to carry a large ugly box bigger than my iPhone to which all these probes attach. In the rest of the world this is a prototype. This product is what the engineers come up with and run tests with, but the customer never sees because no one in their right mind would buy this big ugly, painful piece of sh@#$. In the medical industry this is a completed product that costs $2500. I have a Polar CS600. I use it all the time. You only need to wear a small chest strap - no shaving required. It is wireless and the computer is tiny and light. I'll bet it is as accurate as this stupid torture probe. If they added a function that monitors heart rhythm it would be superior in every way and my CS600 gives me watts. Oh and the CS600 costs $700.</p>\n<p>The medical industry gets away with this crap - including the make the patient miserable part because they answer to no one. I have a choice when I buy my bike computer, but I don't when I need medical attention. I am sure GE builds this probe for cheap. The electronics required to monitor a heart signal are well known and don't require a genius engineer to design. They build it to the minimum required level and then stop - they could care less about user experience because they don't have to.</p>\n<p>I know you will say that they have to deal with the potential for malpractice and yes they do. Which is another thing that is wrong but I'll save that for later.</p>\n<p>The point is that I itch like crazy and I blame GE and a bad shave for it.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-09-12-why-the-medical-industry-sucks/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/why-the-medical-industry-sucks",date:"2007-09-12T06:00:00Z",title:"Why the medical industry sucks",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"For a year now I have been working on a new version  ThePlanCollection.com.

My legs didn't cramp up at the end this time and I met new people and I had a chance to ride with a couple of people from the Space Dynamics Lab. They are always fun to ride with and are good, skilled riders. Interestingly, some of the new people were doctors. Given our wreck during the MS150 it was a comfort to have medical people around and they were a lot of fun to ride with. In all the people I rode with were great. One of the greatest benefits of cycling is the opportunity to meet new people and share a common experience even if what you share is pain.</p>\n<p>I and Jaren started the day at 6:30 instead of 8. The morning part of the ride was beautiful and cool (freezing cold), but I think that is the best way to do the century. It was nice to stop riding when I hit my house rather then have to ride all the way up to Richmond only to have to drive home. I think that part of the ride was one of my favorite.</p>\n<p>It is still fun to see the combination of people that ride in these endurance cycling events. There are young and old and people of all body types. Cycling really is a sport that anyone can enjoy.</p>\n<p>Each time I ride I learn something new or I am reminded of something I should pay attention to. This ride once again featured a wreck. Thankfully, nobody was hurt but one of the riders tacoed his front rim - bent it right in half. At mile 90 riders are very tired and begin to do whatever that have to in order to keep up. The unfortunate part is that because the focus switches to survival this is when people make mistakes. In this instance two riders collided sideways. It was an easy mistake to make, but one that is avoided if you still have your wits (ie aren't suffering from 90 miles of riding). I rode with the guys from SDL on Wednesday and saw a similar crash. No one was hurt and the bikes were ok. In both instances riders were climbing and standing up to sprint to the top of the hill and in both instances one rider was tiring and falling back.\nLesson 1:\nBe aware of your surroundings. Don't assume that there isn't a rider behind you or to the side of you. Know your limits and if you are tired don't try to lead the pack up a hill. If you are the guy in the back always have an escape plan. Look for a clear path that can quickly get you out of a riders way and watch the guys ahead of you. If they are slowing be prepared to back up and find a route around them.\nLesson 2:\nAt mile 90 you are tired. So is everyone else. No matter how many times you have watched Le Tour you are not a pro. Don't try to hang 2\" of the guy in front of you and don't think you are safe in a big pack even if you are a good rider. Someone else will be tired. They are more likely to sprint and then slow and then repeat. The spring effect will wear you out anyway and is dangerous. The draft isn't as good, but it is likely you aren't a pro so slow up if you have to. During our MS150 ride the rider went down in the last miles because he caught the wheel in front of him. It was a nasty crash and took out the guy behind him. No matter how good you are feeling you are dependent on the abilities of the other riders for safety. Hang back a few feet and give yourself some reaction room. You may not be as cool or as fast, but in the long run it is cheaper and safer.\nLesson 3:\nThis is one I adhere to but is worth writing down. If you haven't ridden with someone before then you need to observe their riding before getting to close. Many new riders don't understand a paceline - I am still not that good. They will brake (yikes) when you least expect it. Here again, hang back a bit until you understand their riding style. If they waver back and forth or brake then sprint give them some room. You will lose some draft benefit, but you won't go home with road rash.</p>\n<p>Luckily my stomach feels better this time. I didn't use Acceleraide this time. That stuff gives my stomach fits after I drink 4 bottles of it. Instead, I switched to Perpeteum which tastes like flour which is better than Acceleraide. Not having to spend the next 3 days on the toilet thinking \"what the hell was that?\" makes the extra cost of Perpeteum worth every penny. I love the stuff.</p>\n<p>Right after the ride I felt great. I always feel great for about an hour. Of course after that my right leg cramped up until I was pretty sure I would rather cut it off then endure that kind of pain. I have to figure out what the heck is up with that and do something about it. I took electrolytes and advil this time, but the results were still the same - intense pain and a desire to die.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-08-25-cache-valley-century/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/cache-valley-century",date:"2007-08-25T06:00:00Z",title:"Cache Valley Century",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Every Saturday in Logan and I am sure in towns all across the country there is a small market where locals can sell their wares.

Smaller markets filled with locals are a far more interesting and entertaining shopping experience.

Since riding a mountain bike on the road is like only your SUV to pick up the kids and buy groceries (welcome to America), I needed some time off road with my sexy Blur XC. We went up the River Trail. I love that ride. The part from first dam to the trail head (on the road) sucks. It is made worse by the wind from Logan canyon that blows like a hurricane in the morning. However, once you get past that the River Trail is worth every bit of the pain you endure to get there. To me the River Trail is less about hard core biking and more about enjoying the nature that is so close to Logan. It is also almost like a local social event. You share the trial with other bikers, hikers, joggers, and fisherman. Everyone I have come across thus far has been extremely courteous. I have started seeing the same people on the trail. The River Trail is like a party every morning. It is great.</p>\n<p>At First Dam comes the next part of the commute. In order to stay in the dirt we follow the deer fence trail to Green Canyon. This trail hugs the side of the mountains and offers an incredible view of the entire valley. Rather than build their homes high up on the hill people need to get on their bikes.

It was to be a simple ride - out and back no special fuel needed, no need to worry that I had put in 30 miles on the mountain bike already. However, after we passed the power plant - one of the landmarks we use to indicate it's time to turn around, Jaren said let's go to the top of the dam. The dam really isn't far. Only another mile and a short hill climb and we would be there. I am always up for a hill climb.</p>\n<p>However, we didn't stop there and I wasn't about to be a wus and drop out. Before we knew it we had arrived at the top of Blacksmith Fork Canyon and end marked by Hardware Ranch. Usually, this is not a hard ride for me. We averaged about 16 mph up. I usually manage 20.</p>\n<p>The sun was setting. The canyon looked beautiful highlighted by the final rays of the sun. We got our butts in gear and started back.</p>\n<p>I almost always carry extra fuel - a Cliff bar, some sport beans just something for those just in case moments. I have passed them out to buddies who needed a little something more along the way and most of the time I bring the stuff back home and throw it back into my cycling stash.</p>\n<p>This was to be a simple ride, not far and so for the first time I carried nothing.</p>\n<p>My total mileage for the day would be 70 miles. I can handle that. However, I always handle it with appropriate fuel so guess what...</p>\n<p>I bonked bad. About one mile into the return journey my legs screamed out in terror begging for something. I had not eaten dinner - that never sits well. Instead I had eaten a banana. Those measly calories were long gone.</p>\n<p>When you bonk and you still have 20 miles to go and no cell reception your mind does interesting things. I could taste Cliff bars. My body begged for cherries or rice or peanut butter sandwiches. I even started to imagine that my water was Accelerade which is very bad because I don't usually get along with the stuff. Even though the air was cold and I wasn't sweating I finished off two bottles of water in the few miles back to the power plant - in my mind that liquid somehow contained the energy my body needed and I found myself constantly, unconsciously gulping down vast quantities. We stopped at the power plant and I refilled.</p>\n<p>I was hungry in a very interesting way. Sometimes you feel hungry - like when you watch a movie. This results in popcorn and soda. However, you weren't really hungry you just needed some oral recreation.</p>\n<p>I was hungry hungry. I started scanning the roadways. Every now and then I would see a discarded bottle and think, \"I wonder if there is anything left in there. How bad would it be? Would it really kill me?\" Then I found myself imagining that someone had dropped a completely wrapped Snickers by the road. Oh that would have been so great.</p>\n<p>We passed a family reunion and I wondered what they would think if some goofy looking cyclist dropped by and begged for food. I imagined my self offering them 20 bucks for one of Grandma Thelma's cookies. The urge passed and we road on. The myriad of cars that made up that reunion would soon be headed down the canyon and it was getting dark. I though of the big SUVs. One of the pilots of these monsters would surely be distracted and while chatting with his wife about how cousin Bob just \"came out\" he would ignore the road and smash me against one of the rock walls that line the canyon road.</p>\n<p>Then the bugs started pounding my helmet and I wondered how many calories are in a gnat. I debated opening my mouth wide to try to obtain a mouthful of the little critters. Surely there would be some protein to be had.</p>\n<p>Next I started to wonder if there were any calories in my spit. Maybe I shouldn't be spitting. Perhaps there were a few calories there to be had.</p>\n<p>Bonking is totally disgusting, but hunger and the fact that I was now burning brain cells for fuel made me loopy.</p>\n<p>My legs didn't feel like they were my own. They kept spinning but each stroke came at an enormous cost. It hurt.</p>\n<p>I finally did make it home. I didn't stop to chat with the neighbors outside. I didn't say hi to the kids. I ran to the kitchen and inhaled the bowl of fruit on the table. Then I ate rice and beans. Then I ate yogurt. Then I ate cherries. After that I ate cookies and drank a lot of milk. This to was a mistake I have made after so many rides but I didn't care. It only took about 10 minutes and the pain in my legs was gone. It is amazing what a joy it is to have your legs stop consuming themselves for energy.</p>\n<p>My head was great - likely from the rush of good feeling from the carbs I was scarfing down and probably because of the drunken state I was in from the destruction of some many brain cells that were consumed to keep my legs turning.</p>\n<p>Then I nearly had to puke. The stomach is the worst victim of riding and throwing a buffet of food at it while all the blood is still in the legs will make you ill. I have learned this about 10 times now, but never well enough to stop my post ride gluttony.</p>\n<p>This was added to the fact that I was freezing. The canyon was cold (remember how the sun was going down). I like the cold. I love to stay cool, but this was a different cold. It was as if all the energy used to keep my body warm had been transfered to my legs to finish my last grueling miles.</p>\n<p>So I went to bed.</p>\n<p>About 30 minutes ago I awoke because I had to use the restroom - I drank a LOT of water and because both of my legs cramped up. These weren't charly horse style cramps. These were I can't move because my inner thigh has turned to a rock and I am in so much pain that I wish I could cut off my leg kind of cramps. My left leg knotted in my inner thigh and my right leg knotted at my calf. I couldn't move. I could swear.

Sadly I totally forgot about it until I got home last night and my lovely wife reminded me that the concert I so badly wanted to attend started at 7. My brain doesn\'t work the way it should sometimes.</p>\n<p>So we rushed to Mendon and made it in time to see most of <a href="http://www.sarahsample.com/">Sarah Sample</a>\'s concert. She has a beautiful voice and she writes all of her own music. If you haven\'t heard her artful sound I highly recommend a visit to <a href="http://www.sarahsample.com/">her site</a> and a visit to her <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sarahsamplemusic">MySpace account</a>. I am impressed by independent artists like Sarah. She paid for and produced her albums. I asked when the next one would come out and she told me that it would be after she has paid for the current album. You have to respect an artist with that much devotion. I love her music and can\'t wait until she produces more so I will be recommending that everyone purchase her latest CD.</p>\n<p>It was fun to see that a smaller community like Mendon holds something like a concert in the park. It was filled with families young and old and it made me remember why Cache Valley is such a great place to live.</p>\n<p>There is another free concert next monday night (August 13th). This time its an acoustic variety band named John Boy\'s Mule.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-08-07-sarah-sample/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/sarah-sample",date:"2007-08-07T06:00:00Z",title:"Sarah Sample",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Yesterday, my daughter, out of the blue, told her sunday school teacher, \"I'm so bored I could fall asleep.\" We told her that she shouldn't say things like that to her teachers - she is going to kindergarten in the fall so we need to teach her stuff like that.

Originally I wasn't going to, but my brother was very gung ho and I finally decided that if I was ever going to ride 100 miles I would need a reason to do it.\nWe started at 8 am. Even then it was warm. It was around 95 degree farenheit when we finished. We (Team COSL with David, Leslie and myself included) had a chance to ride with guys from JUB. It was a lot of fun. It was also easier thanks to Dan from JUB and Mahmoud from the Math department at USU pulling almost the entire way. They are amazing riders.</p>\n<p>We did pretty well, passed a lot of people and averaged around 20mph. There were faster groups no doubt but for my first century it was a great group to hang with.</p>\n<p>About 10 miles after lunch with only about 20 miles to go we ran into a bit of disaster. Joe from JUB hit Dan's tire (acutally his derailler we think). You can't believe how fast that will throw a rider to the ground. It looked like something straight from the Tour De France. Mahmoud was right behind Joe and went over his bike before crashing. Dave was next then me. He swerved just in time and I followed him. It is Dave I have to thank for a quick response. We could have all ended up in a big pile.</p>\n<p>Mahmoud came out of the mess ok. He went over the bars and busted his bike computer and the tops of his shifters. Joe was Ok as well, but when he came up most of the skin from his left shoulder was gone, he had some serious gashes on his legs, and his elbow looked like hamburger.</p>\n<p>His helmut was busted.</p>\n<p>If anyone needs a motivation for wearing a helmut they should see his. It probably saved him from a concussion and who knows what else. Afterwards he said he didn't even feel his head hit. Bike helmuts are that good so wear one.</p>\n<p>His bike didn't do so well. The top tube on his fairly new carbon Trek was busted in half. Both shifters were totally destroyed. His real derailer didn't look so good and his handle bars were about 90 degrees from where they should be. Ouch!!</p>\n<p>That experience made me think that I should perhaps consider the bike by Carl Strong. Titanium can be fixed.</p>\n<p>I rode todays century because I wanted to ride but...</p>\n<p>After Joe crashed a lady stopped to help us. She said her husband was riding today and that her mom has MS. Her mom has been pretty depressed about that lately, but today's event touched her and made her feel like there were a lot of people that care (about 3000 riders in fact). I think this event raises about 1.3 million dollars. That is impressive for one day. My wife's best friend's mom died from MS a few years back. It is a terrible disease and I am glad that something like this can help.</p>\n<p>When we reached the end of the tour Joe was there. He looked fine which is good. I am still trying to get a hold of my brother. He called me from the finish so I know he made it there. With a few more miles he will be a great rider.</p>\n<p>My legs cramped up the last 12 miles and are continuing to cramp. I need to found stronger sources of potassium.</p>\n<p>Today was fun.
