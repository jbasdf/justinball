Let it startup for a few minutes</li>\n<li>Plug in the Time Capsule. Wait a few and it should come up with a green light.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That\'s it. It did take a couple of tries for everything to reset and get working, but it\'s better than spending hours reconfiguring the Time Capsule trying to figure out why the cable modem won\'t talk to it.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Get Apple Time Capsule to work with Comcast",date:"August 03, 2010",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
