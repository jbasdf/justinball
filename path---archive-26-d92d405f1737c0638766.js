Originally I wasn't going to, but my brother was very gung ho and I finally decided that if I was ever going to ride 100 miles I would need a reason to do it.\nWe started at 8 am. Even then it was warm. It was around 95 degree farenheit when we finished. We (Team COSL with David, Leslie and myself included) had a chance to ride with guys from JUB. It was a lot of fun. It was also easier thanks to Dan from JUB and Mahmoud from the Math department at USU pulling almost the entire way. They are amazing riders.</p>\n<p>We did pretty well, passed a lot of people and averaged around 20mph. There were faster groups no doubt but for my first century it was a great group to hang with.</p>\n<p>About 10 miles after lunch with only about 20 miles to go we ran into a bit of disaster. Joe from JUB hit Dan's tire (acutally his derailler we think). You can't believe how fast that will throw a rider to the ground. It looked like something straight from the Tour De France. Mahmoud was right behind Joe and went over his bike before crashing. Dave was next then me. He swerved just in time and I followed him. It is Dave I have to thank for a quick response. We could have all ended up in a big pile.</p>\n<p>Mahmoud came out of the mess ok. He went over the bars and busted his bike computer and the tops of his shifters. Joe was Ok as well, but when he came up most of the skin from his left shoulder was gone, he had some serious gashes on his legs, and his elbow looked like hamburger.</p>\n<p>His helmut was busted.</p>\n<p>If anyone needs a motivation for wearing a helmut they should see his. It probably saved him from a concussion and who knows what else. Afterwards he said he didn't even feel his head hit. Bike helmuts are that good so wear one.</p>\n<p>His bike didn't do so well. The top tube on his fairly new carbon Trek was busted in half. Both shifters were totally destroyed. His real derailer didn't look so good and his handle bars were about 90 degrees from where they should be. Ouch!!</p>\n<p>That experience made me think that I should perhaps consider the bike by Carl Strong. Titanium can be fixed.</p>\n<p>I rode todays century because I wanted to ride but...</p>\n<p>After Joe crashed a lady stopped to help us. She said her husband was riding today and that her mom has MS. Her mom has been pretty depressed about that lately, but today's event touched her and made her feel like there were a lot of people that care (about 3000 riders in fact). I think this event raises about 1.3 million dollars. That is impressive for one day. My wife's best friend's mom died from MS a few years back. It is a terrible disease and I am glad that something like this can help.</p>\n<p>When we reached the end of the tour Joe was there. He looked fine which is good. I am still trying to get a hold of my brother. He called me from the finish so I know he made it there. With a few more miles he will be a great rider.</p>\n<p>My legs cramped up the last 12 miles and are continuing to cramp. I need to found stronger sources of potassium.</p>\n<p>Today was fun. A hundred miles doesn't seem so far anymore.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-06-23-finished-my-first-cycling-century-today/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/finished-my-first-cycling-century-today",date:"2007-06-23T06:00:00Z",title:"Finished My First Cycling Century Today",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["COSL","Cycling","cache valley","Cycling","MS150"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"An interesting study by business week shows who is doing what on line .

Aside from my test ride in the parking lot last night was my first real mountain bike riding in over a decade. David, his wife Leslie, his brother Brian and Marc - the bike shop owner all rode. Marc is hardcore. He just took first place in the Norba nationals in Deer Valley. Leslie and Brian were amazing as well.</p>\n<p>I nearly died.</p>\n<p>Our trip took us up Ricks canyon. Being completely unfamiliar with any trails in this area I didn't care where we went. I was just excited to get on my brand new sweet bike.</p>\n<p>Big mistake.</p>\n<p>Ricks Canyon is a natural torture chamber. Someone forgot to actually make a trail and instead figured that anyone who would want to climb here was really stupid and deserved what they got - a constant stream of loose rocks and small boulders mixed with tree roots.</p>\n<p>So ya I am a wus.</p>\n<p>The climb left my heart pounding so heart I was sure it would exit my chest. This was my first time in the hills on clipless pedals. I used brand new Crank Brothers Eggbeaters. I like them, but having some platform on the pedal would probably be a good idea for a newb like me that has to try to clip in to the tiny pedals on a 10% incline. Not an easy task.</p>\n<p>The views from top were amazing - the kind of thing you see in mountain bike brochures. Cache Valley is a beautiful place. On the descent I was glad to have full suspension. The bike took the trail well and saved my sorry butt more than a few times. At high speed down the single track it tackled large boulders with ease and flying off the tree roots that we had endured on the way up was a blast. The sound of rocks slamming into my thousand dollar wheels on the way down was not comforting, but during the entire ride I was glad every second that I bought this bike. It is light for a mountain bike. It is fast. It climbs well. It descends well.</p>\n<p>Its capabilities far exceed the skills of the rider.</p>\n<p>That's a good thing. I went blasting through a section at high speed - didn't mean to just didn't brake soon enough. It was one of the more terrifying moments of the ride. I was going way to fast hitting 2 foot boulders and racing through loose gravel. I am pretty sure that the bike save me there. </p>\n<p>In the mean time of course this was just another day for Marc. Leslie and Brian took the entire thing with ease. </p>\n<p>I need to ride more.</p>\n<p>So my return to mountain biking was a good one. I love being in the outdoors on a bike. The scenery is amazing. The uphill should help me build a stronger heart. Every second of the ride I couldn't help but smile and think to myself this is awesome. Santa Cruz has my vote. The Blur XC is a great bike and the SRAM X0 group did exactly what I asked it to every time. </p>\n<p>I have the MS150 this weekend so it will be a few days before I am on the bike again.

That makes $1100. The Race XXX Lite VR bars run $399.99 while the Race X Lite bars run $279.99 which makes for a difference of $120.</p>\n<p>That totals $1220. I am assuming that the components are those currently listed on the Bontrager website. Maybe they changed the wheels or something but using my current math and assumptions, the Pearl paint job on the 6.9 must run somewhere around $650. Either that or the frames are different.</p>\n<p>I am curious to know where the money goes.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-06-11-differences-between-the-trek-madone-69-and-65/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/differences-between-the-trek-madone-69-and-65",date:"2007-06-11T06:00:00Z",title:"Differences Between the Trek Madone 6.9 and 6.5",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Cycling","2008 Trek Madone","Cycling"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"These are my links for June 10th through June 11th: Carmichael Training Systems: The Coaching Files: Nutrition for the Long Haul  - Bike-Community.net - Mountainbike Forums  - Up The Road  - Bicycle Design: Great shots of the new Madone  - The First 100 Miles  - Trek launches new Madone  - Cycling Plus  - Snapshots That Do More Than Bore Friends - New York Times  -",html:'<p>These are my links for June 10th through June 11th:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.trainright.com/articles.asp?uid=2385">Carmichael Training Systems: The Coaching Files: Nutrition for the Long Haul</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.bike-community.net/">Bike-Community.net - Mountainbike Forums</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://trekroad.typepad.com/">Up The Road</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://bicycledesign.blogspot.com/2007/06/great-shots-of-new-madone.html">Bicycle Design: Great shots of the new Madone</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://sarabest.typepad.com/first100miles/">The First 100 Miles</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.tredzblog.co.uk/2007/06/trek_launches_n.html">Trek launches new Madone</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.cyclingplus.co.uk/newsdetails.asp?id=741">Cycling Plus</a> -</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/travel/10pracphoto.html?ex=1339128000&#x26;en=c527a6fe476ad6c3&#x26;ei=5088&#x26;partner=rssnyt&#x26;emc=rss">Snapshots That Do More Than Bore Friends - New York Times</a> -</li>\n</ul>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2007-06-11-my-delicious-bookmarks-for-june-10th-through-june-11th/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/my-delicious-bookmarks-for-june-10th-through-june-11th",date:"2007-06-11T06:00:00Z",title:"My del.icio.us bookmarks for June 10th through June 11th",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Links","Cycling"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Interesting discussion on the new 2008 Trek Madone seatpost .
