I'll try to put together a detailed post explaining Rails 3 engines later.</p>\n<p>The nice thing about having a test suite in place is that you can rely on those tests to ensure the upgrade is smooth. I've always written my tests in <a href=\"http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda\">Shoulda</a>. I like the syntax and I love the macros. However, I'm switching everything over to RSpec. <a href=\"http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/731871832/this-should-change-your-mind\">Thoughtbot has declared they won't abandon the Shoulda community, but since they've made the switch to RSpec for new projects it's pretty clear that Shoulda as a stand alone project has a limited life.</a></p>\n<p>Luckily I've used RSpec in a lot of other projects and it's an easy DSL to like. The conversion from shoulda to RSpec isn't a terribly difficult one. You basically need to replace \"context\" with describe and then remove your assert statements and replace then with 'should'.</p>\n<p>One of the most difficult issues I've had to deal with is my custom shoulda macros. From what I've read the move to BDD should inspire you to use fewer macros and instead focus on specific behavior. I think that philosophy is great, but I've already got a lot of code that uses the macros and so the macros need to be brought over. The change from shoulda macros to RSpec matchers is painful, but I think the code is cleaner and easier to read.</p>\n<p>For example, I have custom scope macros. Here's the shoulda macro:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n  # Test for 'by_title' named scope which orders by title:\n  # scope :by_title, :order => \"title ASC\"\n  # requires that the class have a shoulda factory\n  def should_scope_by_title\n    klass = get_klass\n    factory_name = name_for_factory(klass)\n    context \"'by_title' title scope\" do\n      setup do\n        klass.delete_all\n        @first = Factory(factory_name, :title => 'a')\n        @second = Factory(factory_name, :title => 'b')\n      end\n      should \"sort by name\" do\n        assert_equal @first, klass.by_title[0]\n        assert_equal @second, klass.by_title[1]\n      end\n    end\n  end\n</pre></code>\n<p>And here's the RSpec matcher:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n# Ensures that the model can sort by_title\n# requires that the class have a factory\n#\n# Tests scope:\n#   scope :by_title, :order => \"title ASC\"\n#\n# Examples:\n#   it { should scope_by_title }\n#\ndef scope_by_title\n  SortingMatcher.new(:by_title, :title)\nend\n\nclass SortingMatcher # :nodoc:\n\n  def initialize(scope, field)\n    @scope = scope\n    @field = field\n  end\n\n  def matches?(subject)\n    @subject = subject\n    @subject.class.delete_all\n    @first = Factory(factory_name, @field => 'a')\n    @second = Factory(factory_name, @field => 'b')\n    @first == @subject.class.send(@scope)[0] && @second == @subject.class.send(@scope)[1]\n  end\n\n  def failure_message\n    \"Expected #{factory_name} to scope by #{@scope} on #{@field}\"\n  end\n\n  def description\n    \"sort by title\"\n  end\n\n  private\n\n    def factory_name\n      @subject.class.name.underscore.to_sym\n    end\n\nend\n</pre></code>\n<p>I don't profess to be a master of either but my tests work so hopefully this helps someone if you're making the same transition.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-09-18-shoulda-used-rspec/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/shoulda-used-rspec",date:"2010-09-18T06:00:00Z",title:"Shoulda used RSpec",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Ruby On Rails","cucumber","rails","rspec","shoulda"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"I've been trying to get  Uploadify  to work inside my <a href=\" http://github.com/jbasdf/uploader\"Uploadify>uploader  gem .

There's a number of solutions that people have come up with, but mostly they sound like voodoo - Be sure to only return a '1', make sure to use an id instead of a css class, etc. I tried everything I read about and finally got mad enough to debug the fla file. </p>\n<p>If you are that desperate make sure to get <a href=\"http://www.actionscript-flash-guru.com/blog/21-fireflash-firebug-console-for-flash\">FireFlash</a>. It will let you write to the Firebug console from within your swf file. It's very handy when you need to see what's going on inside your Actionscript while running inside the browser. I created a debug version of the fla that output the events that the swf file was attempting to fire on the client.  If you want to try it out in hopes it will help you debug <a href='http://www.justinball.comUploadify.zip'>download a zip file with the swf and fla</a>.</p>\n<p>OK so now to the point. What's going wrong? Why doesn't 'onComplete' fire? The answer is that Uploadify binds events to the DOM item you specify via jQuery('#my-upload-container').uploadify(); These events include 'uploadifySelect', 'uploadifyOpen', 'uploadifyProgress', 'uploadifyComplete', etc. What I found is that the swf makes a call that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">\nExternalInterface.call(['jQuery'+p(q('#'+param.uploadifyID)), p(list.join(','))].join('.trigger'));\n</pre></code>\n<p>That call does it's job - I can watch it make the ExternalInterface calls using FireFlash. The swf file attempts to trigger the events I listed above that have been bound to the element identified by id=\"my-upload-container\". However, something goes wrong and somehow the\n'my-upload-container' element loses it's bindings and nothing is fired.</p>\n<p>I found I can get things to work if I change 'jquery.uploadify.js' to bind the events above to the document instead of to the DOM element and then change the fla to do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">\nExternalInterface.call(['jQuery(document)', p(list.join(','))].join('.trigger'));\n</pre></code>\n<p>That means that the events do fire however it's a hack so I kept digging (and swearing) and I bummed some help off Joel.....</p>\n<p>It turns out that the problem wasn't Flash. It wasn't uploadify. It wasn't jQuery although all of those components seemed like they might be the source of the problem.  The problem as it turns out was TinyMCE. (As it turns out TinyMCE is the source of a lot of my problems but I still like it).</p>\n<p>In our specific case we've built a plugin to TinyMCE that let's you upload files to the server. (You can find it in the <a href=\"http://github.com/tatemae/muck-contents\">muck-contents gem</a>). We use the TinyMCE scripts to build our popups which means using 'tiny<em>mce/tiny</em>mce_popup.js'. If you look in that code very deeply you will discover this code around line 320:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">\n  if ((nv = t.editor.translate(h)) && nv != h)\n    document.body.innerHTML = nv;\n</pre></code>\n<p>Notice that the way the popup handles translations is to replace the entire document with new html. If you use jQuery and your bindings have already been setup you realize this is very bad because everything you've setup using the standard methods just vanished. (This goes for all methods - click, bind, etc. They will all go away).</p>\n<p>ie This won't work:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">\njQuery(document).ready(function(){\n   jQuery('#mce_uploader_upload').uploadify(mce_uploader_options);\n});\n</pre></code>\n<p>The solution is simple and probably obvious to a seasoned TinyMCE dev (which I'm not). Put your code into a different initialization block:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">\ntinyMCEPopup.onInit.add(function(ed) {\n   jQuery('#mce_uploader_upload').uploadify(mce_uploader_options);\n});\n</pre></code>\n<p>As an aside I should mention that if you need help getting uploadify running in your Rails application there's already a couple of great tutorials.

A wave crashes over my head and I have a choice - save my sunglass and let go or hold on for dear life and maybe not die. I chose the latter and Bear Lake consumes a pair of Oakley sunglasses. Jeff had told me about a time he and some friends had a competition to see who could stay on a tube the longest. One of his buddies refused to let go and at one point he is faced with a choice - hold onto the tube and win or hold onto his swim trunks. He chose the first option and won, but returned to the boat butt naked. In light of that choice I'm glad all I lost was a pair of sunglasses.</p>\n<p>90k buys you an amazing machine.

I and Joel took a couple of S3s up Smithfield Canyon. Cervelo calls the S3 the fastest bike in the peleton due to it's aerodynamic design. The guys at the demo claimed a 15 watt savings. Their site says 10. I wondered how big of a difference it could make.</p>\n<p>Turns out it makes a big difference. I normally ride a Madone 6.9 which is a pretty nice ride. The S3 felt faster. It is a bike that flies. Now the S3 comes with Zipp 404s while I ride XXX Lites. I'd really like to throw those wheels on my bike and get a feel for the ride difference (I'm thinking I might need some wheels for Christmas). </p>\n<p>We had a great time. The fit on the S3 was great. I was frequently surprised at how fast I was going given the power output. I have a good feel for how fast I should be going at a given effort and the difference was noticeable. It is a super light bike. It is an incredibly fun bike. It accelerated fast. It was easy to keep going fast. However, it sends up a lot more road noise than some of the other super bikes I've ridden (like my Madone or a Time). It wasn't as comfortable as my current bike but on shorter rides old guys like me wouldn't notice/care.</p>\n<p>Would I buy this bike? I think so. It was a heck of a lot of fun and I think I would buy it just for that. However, it's probably a couple down on my list.

If you include fireeagle 0.8.0.1 in your project and make that call you will get an error like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\nActionView::TemplateError (wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)) on line #7 of /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/muck-invites-0.1.12/app/views/invites/_gmail_oauth.erb:\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/oauth-0.4.0/lib/oauth/consumer.rb:154:in `create_http'\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/oauth-0.4.0/lib/oauth/consumer.rb:154:in `request'\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/oauth-0.4.0/lib/oauth/tokens/consumer_token.rb:25:in `request'\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/oauth-0.4.0/lib/oauth/tokens/access_token.rb:11:in `request'\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/oauth-0.4.0/lib/oauth/tokens/access_token.rb:24:in `get'\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/portablecontacts-0.1.0/lib/portable_contacts.rb:55:in `get'\n    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/portablecontacts-0.1.0/lib/portable_contacts.rb:43:in `all'\n    /Users/jbasdf/projects/muck-oauth/app/helpers/muck_oauth_helper.rb:32:in `gmail_contacts'\n    /Users/jbasdf/projects/muck-oauth/app/helpers/muck_oauth_helper.rb:16:in `gmail_contacts_as_array'\n</pre></code>\n<p>Naturally you will follow the stack trace down to the call in the oauth gem to create_http. Then you will look at the call to it and everything will look fine. The oauth gem works for everyone else. Why does it not work? WTF? Stupid code. I should have dropped out of engineering and become a business major. Seriously WTF? This code is never even called. What the hell!!!!!</p>\n<p>Then you will remember that ruby is the best, most awesome language ever and you can replace methods dynamically on the fly, and  you will figure out that the create_http method being called is not the one in the file you are looking at.</p>\n<p>Next you get to figure out what method is being called. It took a lot of colorful language, some lost hair, my wife almost left me, but by luck I found it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n# FireEagle addition to the <code>OAuth::Consumer</code> class\nclass OAuth::Consumer\n  alias_method :create_http_with_verify, :create_http\n  # Monkey patch to silence the SSL warnings\n  def create_http_without_verify #:nodoc:\n    http_object             = create_http_with_verify\n    http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE if uri.scheme==\"https\"\n    http_object\n  end\n  alias_method :create_http, :create_http_without_verify\nend\n</pre></code>\n<p>Death to the bastard that wrote that code.</p>\n<p>Here's what the code inside oauth looks like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ruby\">\n    # Instantiates the http object\n    def create_http(_url = nil)\n      if _url.nil? || _url[0] =~ /^\\//\n        our_uri = URI.parse(site)\n      else\n        our_uri = URI.parse(_url)\n      end\n\n      if proxy.nil?\n        http_object = Net::HTTP.new(our_uri.host, our_uri.port)\n      else\n        proxy_uri = proxy.is_a?(URI) ? proxy : URI.parse(proxy)\n        http_object = Net::HTTP.new(our_uri.host, our_uri.port, proxy_uri.host, proxy_uri.port, proxy_uri.user, proxy_uri.password)\n      end\n\n      http_object.use_ssl = (our_uri.scheme == 'https')\n\n      if @options[:ca_file] || CA_FILE\n        http_object.ca_file = @options[:ca_file] || CA_FILE\n        http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER\n        http_object.verify_depth = 5\n      else\n        http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE\n      end\n\n      http_object\n    end\n</pre></code>\n<p>Notice that the new method in the oauth gem takes optional parameters while the monkey patched version doesn't? MonkeyPatching causes me to use words that destroy my eternal salvation. Stop it.</p>\n<p>I couldn't figure out why no one else has had this problem. Maybe someone has but it was the combination of gems I was playing with that caused the problem. I dropped fireeagle from the project and everything magically started working.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-06-02-fireeagle-and-portablecontacts-dont-get-along-that-makes-daddy-mad/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/fireeagle-and-portablecontacts-dont-get-along-that-makes-daddy-mad",date:"2010-06-02T06:00:00Z",title:"Fireeagle and PortableContacts Don&#8217;t Get Along.
