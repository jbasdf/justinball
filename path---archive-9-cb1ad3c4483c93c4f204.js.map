My wife is girl's camp director which means she gets to spend 6 months planning for a week long event. She is really good at what she does and it always goes off splendidly. I'm sure they'd love for her to do it again another year, but I knocked her up. (We're having a boy).</p>\\n<p>I volunteered to help. Of course I was careful about how I volunteered and chose the day they spent at the beach playing in the water instead of the day they do a five mile hike. Volunteering is hard I know, but sometimes you have to sacrifice. Part of my job was to make sure no one died. I figured that was a pretty easy task.</p>\\n<p>No one died.</p>\\n<p>However, I came awfully close when towards the end of our excursion I was talked into riding on the boat (aka suicide machine) one of the guys (Paul) brought up. I thought it was just one of those guy bonding things where he drives us out and shows off this awesome machine with 510HP. Guys do that. They buy expensive toys. They show the toys off to the other guys. The other guys get jealous, take out a 2nd mortage and buy a 550HP boat. (By the way that's how SUV's were invented. We started out with small pickups and the testosterone took over.)</p>\\n<p>Anyway, back to my near death experience. So I'm ready to go back because my wife said I could only play for 15 minutes and we needed to pack up and there is a schedule and I am an obedient husband and I do everything my wife says.</p>\\n<p>Then Paul says, \\\"you guys want to ride the tube?\\\" and I say no way, but Jeff (other guy with death wish) says, \\\"sure.\\\" Now I'm stuck with a life decision. Do I look like a wus and just ride in the boat or do I suck it up and take it like a man.</p>\\n<p>I take it like a man - literally.</p>\\n<p>The next moments of my life can only be described as excruciating excitement. It was kind of like being in a car accident and having a high powered water enema that lasted for 15 minutes. I had tried various water sports as a kid and remembered that they always ended in pain for me. Today I relearned that lesson. </p>\\n<p>At one point the tube goes vertical and I find myself flying through the air. A wave crashes over my head and I have a choice - save my sunglass and let go or hold on for dear life and maybe not die. I chose the latter and Bear Lake consumes a pair of Oakley sunglasses. Jeff had told me about a time he and some friends had a competition to see who could stay on a tube the longest. One of his buddies refused to let go and at one point he is faced with a choice - hold onto the tube and win or hold onto his swim trunks. He chose the first option and won, but returned to the boat butt naked. In light of that choice I'm glad all I lost was a pair of sunglasses.</p>\\n<p>90k buys you an amazing machine.

I supposed that the other thing 90k buys you is plenty of opportunities to beat the crap out of your friends.</p>\\n<p>That's 90k well spent.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-08-11-i-spent-my-day-with-hot-young-girls/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/i-spent-my-day-with-hot-young-girls\",\"date\":\"2010-08-11T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"I Spent My Day With Hot, Young Girls\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I ran into a 'fun' error with an application I've been working on.

I and Joel took a couple of S3s up Smithfield Canyon. Cervelo calls the S3 the fastest bike in the peleton due to it's aerodynamic design. The guys at the demo claimed a 15 watt savings. Their site says 10. I wondered how big of a difference it could make.</p>\\n<p>Turns out it makes a big difference. I normally ride a Madone 6.9 which is a pretty nice ride. The S3 felt faster. It is a bike that flies. Now the S3 comes with Zipp 404s while I ride XXX Lites. I'd really like to throw those wheels on my bike and get a feel for the ride difference (I'm thinking I might need some wheels for Christmas). </p>\\n<p>We had a great time. The fit on the S3 was great. I was frequently surprised at how fast I was going given the power output. I have a good feel for how fast I should be going at a given effort and the difference was noticeable. It is a super light bike. It is an incredibly fun bike. It accelerated fast. It was easy to keep going fast. However, it sends up a lot more road noise than some of the other super bikes I've ridden (like my Madone or a Time). It wasn't as comfortable as my current bike but on shorter rides old guys like me wouldn't notice/care.</p>\\n<p>Would I buy this bike? I think so. It was a heck of a lot of fun and I think I would buy it just for that. However, it's probably a couple down on my list. My next bike will likely be a custom titanium from <a href=\\\"http://www.strongframes.com/\\\">Carl Strong</a>. Someday I'd like to buy one from <a href=\\\"http://www.crumptoncycles.com/\\\">Crumpton</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.calfeedesign.com/\\\">Calfee</a>. You don't drop 7-10k on a bike everyday and so in that class there is a lot of incredible hardware to choose from. Also, I feel like for the money those bikes deserve a higher place in the queue. The Cervelo is made in China and is <a href=\\\"http://forums.cervelo.com/forums/p/5956/42332.aspx\\\">rumored to have a few quality problems</a>. In the end the ride and the fun is what matters but those factors being equal I'd pick the higher quality bike with the sexier pedigree.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-07-25-cervelo-eride-came-to-logan/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/cervelo-eride-came-to-logan\",\"date\":\"2010-07-25T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Cervelo eRide Came to Logan\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been a big fan of  Userfly  because they make usability testing easy.

The errors were annoying things like \\\"jQuery(\\\"form.ajax\\\").ajaxForm is not a function\\\". I knew for a fact that jquery.form.js was loaded. I could see the code.

In development everything worked fine. I swore a lot because that is the worst kind of error. yYou feel like you need to debug on the server or setup a staging server.

I couldn't reproduce the error until I remembered a recent <a href=\\\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/221-subdomains-in-rails-3\\\">RailsCast about subdomains in Rails 3</a>. He had mentioned a couple of domains you can use that others have kindly set to point at localhost. I used '<a href=\\\"http://smackaho.st:3000/&#x27;\\\">http://smackaho.st:3000/'</a>. Sure enough, the javascript errors started showing up which led me to do a bit more searching. I discovered that if you load jQuery and then load it again it will essentially reset your environment. I searched all my code to make sure I wasn't committing this sin and sure enough I wasn't.</p>\\n<p>The fact that the error only showed up when the domain changed to a production style domain led me to the javascript that we've inserted into the site to make third party services work. I started removing them one at a time and sure enough as soon as I removed userfly everything started working again.</p>\\n<p>I didn't investigate their code in depth but I'm betting they load jQuery and that it resets the jQuery environment essentially dumping everything I load.</p>\\n<p>Lesson learned, sort of. These days we rely on third-party services for everything from analytics to usability to comments and the list goes on. It's hard to not use these services as they make your life a lot easier but don't be afraid to throw them aside if you start getting random errors on your site.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-07-20-userfly-ruined-my-weekend-jqueryform-ajax-ajaxform-is-not-a-function/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/userfly-ruined-my-weekend-jqueryform-ajax-ajaxform-is-not-a-function\",\"date\":\"2010-07-20T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Userfly Ruined My Weekend &#8211; &#8220;jQuery(&#8220;form.ajax&#8221;).ajaxForm is not a function&#8221;\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"If you are a true geek and you are visiting Paris and you have an iPad (if you are a true geek then you do) then your first stop has to be the Louvre.

I'm sure they'd love for her to do it again another year, but I knocked her up. (We're having a boy).</p>\\n<p>I volunteered to help. Of course I was careful about how I volunteered and chose the day they spent at the beach playing in the water instead of the day they do a five mile hike. Volunteering is hard I know, but sometimes you have to sacrifice. Part of my job was to make sure no one died. I figured that was a pretty easy task.</p>\\n<p>No one died.</p>\\n<p>However, I came awfully close when towards the end of our excursion I was talked into riding on the boat (aka suicide machine) one of the guys (Paul) brought up. I thought it was just one of those guy bonding things where he drives us out and shows off this awesome machine with 510HP. Guys do that. They buy expensive toys. They show the toys off to the other guys. The other guys get jealous, take out a 2nd mortage and buy a 550HP boat. (By the way that's how SUV's were invented. We started out with small pickups and the testosterone took over.)</p>\\n<p>Anyway, back to my near death experience. So I'm ready to go back because my wife said I could only play for 15 minutes and we needed to pack up and there is a schedule and I am an obedient husband and I do everything my wife says.</p>\\n<p>Then Paul says, \\\"you guys want to ride the tube?\\\" and I say no way, but Jeff (other guy with death wish) says, \\\"sure.\\\" Now I'm stuck with a life decision. Do I look like a wus and just ride in the boat or do I suck it up and take it like a man.</p>\\n<p>I take it like a man - literally.</p>\\n<p>The next moments of my life can only be described as excruciating excitement. It was kind of like being in a car accident and having a high powered water enema that lasted for 15 minutes. I had tried various water sports as a kid and remembered that they always ended in pain for me. Today I relearned that lesson. </p>\\n<p>At one point the tube goes vertical and I find myself flying through the air. A wave crashes over my head and I have a choice - save my sunglass and let go or hold on for dear life and maybe not die. I chose the latter and Bear Lake consumes a pair of Oakley sunglasses. Jeff had told me about a time he and some friends had a competition to see who could stay on a tube the longest. One of his buddies refused to let go and at one point he is faced with a choice - hold onto the tube and win or hold onto his swim trunks. He chose the first option and won, but returned to the boat butt naked. In light of that choice I'm glad all I lost was a pair of sunglasses.</p>\\n<p>90k buys you an amazing machine.

I've written before about modifying the request.\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.justinball.comjquery-ajax-get-in-firefox-post-in-internet-explorer\\\">http://www.justinball.comjquery-ajax-get-in-firefox-post-in-internet-explorer</a></p>\\n<p>Taking the code from that post I just add a bit more information. Specifically include this line:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n  request.setRequestHeader(\\\"X-Requested-With\\\", \\\"XMLHttpRequest\\\");\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Your setup ends up looking something like this.  Drop this code into application.js and the ajax requests made via JQuery should start showing up as javascript format.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n  jQuery(document).ajaxSend(function(event, request, settings) {\\n    request.setRequestHeader(\\\"Accept\\\", \\\"text/javascript\\\");\\n  \\trequest.setRequestHeader(\\\"X-Requested-With\\\", \\\"XMLHttpRequest\\\");\\n    request.setRequestHeader(\\\"Content-Type\\\", \\\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\\");\\n    if (settings.type.toUpperCase() == 'GET' || typeof(AUTH_TOKEN) == \\\"undefined\\\") return;\\n    // settings.data is a serialized string like \\\"foo=bar&baz=boink\\\" (or null)\\n    settings.data = settings.data || \\\"\\\";\\n   \\tif (typeof(AUTH_TOKEN) != \\\"undefined\\\")\\n    \\tsettings.data += (settings.data ? \\\"&\\\" : \\\"\\\") + \\\"authenticity_token=\\\" + encodeURIComponent(AUTH_TOKEN);\\n  });\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>I'm using the jquery.form plugin so my code ends up looking like this:</p>\\n<p>function apply<em>ajax</em>forms() {\\njQuery('form.ajax').ajaxForm({\\ndataType: 'script',\\nbeforeSend: add_headers\\n});\\njQuery('form.ajax').append('<input type=\\\"hidden\\\" name=\\\"format\\\" value=\\\"js\\\" />');\\n}</p>\\n<p>Passing the format as a hidden field to Rails ensures that the proper format handler is called.  It isn't the cleanest, but it works reliably and to make a normal form into an ajax form all I need to do is add 'ajax' as a css class.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-08-09-jquery-ajax-requests-are-html-not-js/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/jquery-ajax-requests-are-html-not-js\",\"date\":\"2010-08-09T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"jQuery Ajax requests are &#8216;html&#8217; not &#8216;js&#8217;\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"On a site I'm working on I started noticed a lot of production errors like this: ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql::Error: Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction: UPDATE  users  SET  counter  = 2,  updated_at  = '2010-08-05 20:54:26' WHERE  id  = 1234 I traced the error back to a call in the user model: increment! is an ActiveRecord call.

I and Joel took a couple of S3s up Smithfield Canyon. Cervelo calls the S3 the fastest bike in the peleton due to it's aerodynamic design. The guys at the demo claimed a 15 watt savings. Their site says 10. I wondered how big of a difference it could make.</p>\\n<p>Turns out it makes a big difference. I normally ride a Madone 6.9 which is a pretty nice ride. The S3 felt faster. It is a bike that flies. Now the S3 comes with Zipp 404s while I ride XXX Lites. I'd really like to throw those wheels on my bike and get a feel for the ride difference (I'm thinking I might need some wheels for Christmas). </p>\\n<p>We had a great time. The fit on the S3 was great. I was frequently surprised at how fast I was going given the power output. I have a good feel for how fast I should be going at a given effort and the difference was noticeable. It is a super light bike. It is an incredibly fun bike. It accelerated fast. It was easy to keep going fast. However, it sends up a lot more road noise than some of the other super bikes I've ridden (like my Madone or a Time). It wasn't as comfortable as my current bike but on shorter rides old guys like me wouldn't notice/care.</p>\\n<p>Would I buy this bike? I think so. It was a heck of a lot of fun and I think I would buy it just for that. However, it's probably a couple down on my list. My next bike will likely be a custom titanium from <a href=\\\"http://www.strongframes.com/\\\">Carl Strong</a>. Someday I'd like to buy one from <a href=\\\"http://www.crumptoncycles.com/\\\">Crumpton</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.calfeedesign.com/\\\">Calfee</a>. You don't drop 7-10k on a bike everyday and so in that class there is a lot of incredible hardware to choose from. Also, I feel like for the money those bikes deserve a higher place in the queue. The Cervelo is made in China and is <a href=\\\"http://forums.cervelo.com/forums/p/5956/42332.aspx\\\">rumored to have a few quality problems</a>. In the end the ride and the fun is what matters but those factors being equal I'd pick the higher quality bike with the sexier pedigree.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-07-25-cervelo-eride-came-to-logan/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/cervelo-eride-came-to-logan\",\"date\":\"2010-07-25T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Cervelo eRide Came to Logan\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I've been a big fan of  Userfly  because they make usability testing easy.

The errors were annoying things like \\\"jQuery(\\\"form.ajax\\\").ajaxForm is not a function\\\". I knew for a fact that jquery.form.js was loaded. I could see the code.

In development everything worked fine. I swore a lot because that is the worst kind of error. yYou feel like you need to debug on the server or setup a staging server.

I couldn't reproduce the error until I remembered a recent <a href=\\\"http://railscasts.com/episodes/221-subdomains-in-rails-3\\\">RailsCast about subdomains in Rails 3</a>. He had mentioned a couple of domains you can use that others have kindly set to point at localhost. I used '<a href=\\\"http://smackaho.st:3000/&#x27;\\\">http://smackaho.st:3000/'</a>. Sure enough, the javascript errors started showing up which led me to do a bit more searching. I discovered that if you load jQuery and then load it again it will essentially reset your environment. I searched all my code to make sure I wasn't committing this sin and sure enough I wasn't.</p>\\n<p>The fact that the error only showed up when the domain changed to a production style domain led me to the javascript that we've inserted into the site to make third party services work. I started removing them one at a time and sure enough as soon as I removed userfly everything started working again.</p>\\n<p>I didn't investigate their code in depth but I'm betting they load jQuery and that it resets the jQuery environment essentially dumping everything I load.</p>\\n<p>Lesson learned, sort of. These days we rely on third-party services for everything from analytics to usability to comments and the list goes on.

It took a lot of colorful language, some lost hair, my wife almost left me, but by luck I found it:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n# FireEagle addition to the <code>OAuth::Consumer</code> class\\nclass OAuth::Consumer\\n  alias_method :create_http_with_verify, :create_http\\n  # Monkey patch to silence the SSL warnings\\n  def create_http_without_verify #:nodoc:\\n    http_object             = create_http_with_verify\\n    http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE if uri.scheme==\\\"https\\\"\\n    http_object\\n  end\\n  alias_method :create_http, :create_http_without_verify\\nend\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Death to the bastard that wrote that code.</p>\\n<p>Here's what the code inside oauth looks like:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"ruby\\\">\\n    # Instantiates the http object\\n    def create_http(_url = nil)\\n      if _url.nil? || _url[0] =~ /^\\\\//\\n        our_uri = URI.parse(site)\\n      else\\n        our_uri = URI.parse(_url)\\n      end\\n\\n      if proxy.nil?\\n        http_object = Net::HTTP.new(our_uri.host, our_uri.port)\\n      else\\n        proxy_uri = proxy.is_a?(URI) ? proxy : URI.parse(proxy)\\n        http_object = Net::HTTP.new(our_uri.host, our_uri.port, proxy_uri.host, proxy_uri.port, proxy_uri.user, proxy_uri.password)\\n      end\\n\\n      http_object.use_ssl = (our_uri.scheme == 'https')\\n\\n      if @options[:ca_file] || CA_FILE\\n        http_object.ca_file = @options[:ca_file] || CA_FILE\\n        http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER\\n        http_object.verify_depth = 5\\n      else\\n        http_object.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE\\n      end\\n\\n      http_object\\n    end\\n</pre></code>\\n<p>Notice that the new method in the oauth gem takes optional parameters while the monkey patched version doesn't? MonkeyPatching causes me to use words that destroy my eternal salvation. Stop it.</p>\\n<p>I couldn't figure out why no one else has had this problem. Maybe someone has but it was the combination of gems I was playing with that caused the problem. I dropped fireeagle from the project and everything magically started working.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2010-06-02-fireeagle-and-portablecontacts-dont-get-along-that-makes-daddy-mad/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/fireeagle-and-portablecontacts-dont-get-along-that-makes-daddy-mad\",\"date\":\"2010-06-02T06:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Fireeagle and PortableContacts Don&#8217;t Get Along.

I've heard that one child isn't to bad. We'll never know. We started with two. For us it's been crowd control all along. We don't let the kids go to the car and wait for us anymore. The last time we did we went out and my dear, sweet little girls were punching each other engaged in a full on brawl in their church dresses. That's our redneck roots coming through right there. Today I heard Aubrey scream. Apparently Devin had punched her right after body slamming Alyssa. Asked \\\"what are you doing?\\\" He said, \\\"hurting my sisters.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Last night Jenna threw a fit because Callie cut her finger nails. She went to bed in hysterics. As a father it's my duty to comfort my children so I started a pillow fight. Callie doesn't approve but Jenna thought it was funny and calmed down after she whipped me with a blanket. Something about taking out aggression on your dad brings joy to the soul.</p>\\n<p>Devin's learning his letters. I was working on a graphic today - a $. Devin comes along and says nice 'assssss'. Callie comes in and sits down and Devin tells her, 'Dad has a nice assssss'. I figure it must be all that biking.

He tells us, \\\"if you don't give me candy I'll throw up.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Today he plugged the sink, turned on the water and got all wet. He wasn't happy about being wet so he came and told Callie that he needed his clothes washed. Callie told him \\\"no you don't.\\\" Luckily she's a mom and deduced that wet clothes means water.
