Today we got our first call from their teacher. Apparently, Aubrey pinched someone. Callie said that Aubrey realized when her teacher called and ran and hid under the bed. I guess she had to 'pull a card' at school which is a lot like being sentenced to 15 to 20. </p>\n<p>I asked her what she did wrong and she wouldn't answer. Then I said that instead of pinching perhaps we need to enroll her in karate so that she can learn to fight properly. I don't think Callie was amused.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Our First &#8216;Phone Call&#8217;",date:"April 09, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/our-first-phone-call"}}}});
