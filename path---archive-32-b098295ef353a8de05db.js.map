They enable social logistics\\nthat would otherwise be impossible.  I think that more learning than we\\ncan yet imagine will occur in this informal setting.  Best of all, it\\nwill be free.  At least it should be.</p>\\n<p>Going back to a <a href=\\\"/2005-11-04-learning-is-more-about-assembling-raw-materials-than-about-objects/\\\">previous post</a>\\nI talked about learning objects being more like raw materials than\\neasily reusable items.  For years programmers have sought the holy\\ngrail of reusable software objects.  Problem is, no matter how hard we\\ntry, the objects are never quite reusable.  You always have to modify\\nsomething.  Usually you search on the net and find something close to\\nwhat you need to solve your problem.  Then you hack on it until it\\nmeets your exact need.  My wife is a teacher.  Guess what.  They do the\\nsame thing.  They find a material that will help them teach.  They\\nmight get it from a lesson book, another teacher, an old worksheet, the\\nInternet or make it up.  They cut it apart and paste it back together\\n(using actual tape or glue) make copies and use it to teach.</p>\\n<p>Learning objects need to work the same way.  For them to be useful you\\nhave to be able to get in and hack on them.  Break them down extract\\nthe parts you need and reuse that.  No matter how granular you think\\nyour object is someone will find a new context in which it wasn't\\ngranular enough.  I know someone will argue that an image is granular,\\nbut I have seen my wife cut those up.  I have found images with a color\\nI liked and just used that so unless your objects are single pixels\\ndon't ever bet on them being the perfect level of granular.</p>\\n<p>I digress.  I always do.  Get used to it.  If you don't\\nlike it you can read someone else's blather.  Back to the main\\npoint.</p>\\n<p>I have changed.  Instead of the Utopian view of computers building\\nperfect, customized, efficient instruction I know believe that the more\\nnatural, dare I say evolutionary approach is working better.  Every day\\nmillions individuals contribute useful information into the ether know\\nas the Internet.  They don't do it with clear learning objectives in\\nmind.  Instead they do it because they want to.  Every day millions of\\npeople read the stuff on the Internet and they learn then the remix and\\nreuse the stuff and produce other stuff that helps other people learn. \\nWow.  They don't always have clear objectives in mind, but with a\\nlittle effort the knowledge gained improves their lives. </p>\\n<p>Welcome to learning

and\\ncontext.  In the mean time I have also been reading some of Dumbing Us\\nDown by John Gatto.  In order for learning object to be reused some\\neffort must be made to remove the\\ncontext from learning objects.  Gatto's criticizis the move to\\nremove learning from its original context and his ideas have had an\\neffect on me.  Learning\\nobject proponents would argue that you remove the context from the\\nobject so that it is more reusable, but that removing context is fine\\nsince before the instruction is finished you go back and wrap the\\nobjects in context.  I would argue that for some objects the context is\\nthe learning and that by removing the context you remove all that is\\nvaluable from the object.</p>\\n<p>The result of this thinking has altered my view of how we assemble\\ninstruction. I agree that some objects are useful on their own.  An\\nimage can be reused in multiple instances.  Sometimes a math problem\\ncan be reused easily. What about an article on the web? I would argue\\nthat the article itself contains context.</p>\\n<p>Both components constitute the learning experience, but\\nthe point is that the objects themselves lack context.  I think it is\\nmore complex.  Some objects are useful on their own.  However, many\\nobjects require the context that they were generated in to make sense,\\nand still other digital objects are kind of useful but only if you can\\ntake them apart and reuse parts of them.  It might be true that in an\\nideal setting all objects would be labeled with all kinds of meta data\\nthat would then let some really fancy computer software build\\ncustomized instruction at the learner's whim.  However, the more\\npractical solution is development of new learning materials using\\nexisting objects ie the billions of web pages, images, flash files,\\nbits of source code, applets, pdfs, etc.</p>\\n<p>Reusing these objects is kind of like building a house or a car or some\\nreal object.  You buy the tires for the car, the chips for the\\nelectronics, you get the glass from another supplier and so on.  You be\\nable to buy sheet metal but it doesn't look like a car so you will need\\nto rework it.  This will produce some waste.  In an ideal world you\\ncould just get the exact piece you need for the front fender but it\\nisn't going to happen anytime soon.  Other parts you will make from\\nscratch yourself.  You might have an in-house group that forges the\\nengine block etc.  At any rate the finished product works great or at\\nleast it works good for some specific purpose.  Sports cars don't work\\nif you need to haul the family around and you probably don't want to\\nhaul dirt in the back seat of your Cadillac.</p>\\n<p>Instruction isn't all that different.  The end product might be built\\nfrom some objects and some raw material.  Some of it you will have to\\nbuild yourself.  Sometimes you will try to reuse someone elses\\ninstruction and find that you have to throw away a lot of it to make it\\nfit.  That is OK.  Whatever you do you better make sure that the\\ninstruction that you end up with is well suited for the specific task\\nand that it is effective at what it does.  It might be a Ferrari, but\\nif it needs to carry the family you have failed.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2005-11-04-learning-is-more-about-assembling-raw-materials-than-about-objects/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/learning-is-more-about-assembling-raw-materials-than-about-objects\",\"date\":\"2005-11-04T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Learning is more about assembling raw materials than about objects\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I have been reading through more of  Dave Wiley's learning objects text book  so\\nthat I can claim to be doing something vaguely academic.  I'll\\nwrite more about learning objects and how I don't think they are all\\nthat useful in a bit, but in the mean time my brain is off on another\\ntangent.  I have been thinking more about the educational system\\nand instruction in general.  Throw into that mix the…\",\"html\":\"<p>I have been reading through more of <a href=\\\"http://opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Conversations_About_Learning_Objects\\\">Dave Wiley's learning objects text book </a>so\\nthat I can claim to be doing something vaguely academic.  I'll\\nwrite more about learning objects and how I don't think they are all\\nthat useful in a bit, but in the mean time my brain is off on another\\ntangent.  I have been thinking more about the educational system\\nand instruction in general.  Throw into that mix the fact that I\\nam a student and then add in my generally lazy/rebelious/I don't give a\\n***| attitude and you get an argument about why we need to have\\nobjects.  I got thinking about why it is that we are required to\\nachieve certain goals in our education.  The teacher gives an\\nassigment -

They enable social logistics\\nthat would otherwise be impossible.  I think that more learning than we\\ncan yet imagine will occur in this informal setting.  Best of all, it\\nwill be free.  At least it should be.</p>\\n<p>Going back to a <a href=\\\"/2005-11-04-learning-is-more-about-assembling-raw-materials-than-about-objects/\\\">previous post</a>\\nI talked about learning objects being more like raw materials than\\neasily reusable items.  For years programmers have sought the holy\\ngrail of reusable software objects.  Problem is, no matter how hard we\\ntry, the objects are never quite reusable.  You always have to modify\\nsomething.  Usually you search on the net and find something close to\\nwhat you need to solve your problem.  Then you hack on it until it\\nmeets your exact need.  My wife is a teacher.  Guess what.  They do the\\nsame thing.  They find a material that will help them teach.  They\\nmight get it from a lesson book, another teacher, an old worksheet, the\\nInternet or make it up.  They cut it apart and paste it back together\\n(using actual tape or glue) make copies and use it to teach.</p>\\n<p>Learning objects need to work the same way.  For them to be useful you\\nhave to be able to get in and hack on them.  Break them down extract\\nthe parts you need and reuse that.  No matter how granular you think\\nyour object is someone will find a new context in which it wasn't\\ngranular enough.  I know someone will argue that an image is granular,\\nbut I have seen my wife cut those up.  I have found images with a color\\nI liked and just used that so unless your objects are single pixels\\ndon't ever bet on them being the perfect level of granular.</p>\\n<p>I digress.  I always do.  Get used to it.  If you don't\\nlike it you can read someone else's blather.  Back to the main\\npoint.</p>\\n<p>I have changed.  Instead of the Utopian view of computers building\\nperfect, customized, efficient instruction I know believe that the more\\nnatural, dare I say evolutionary approach is working better.  Every day\\nmillions individuals contribute useful information into the ether know\\nas the Internet.  They don't do it with clear learning objectives in\\nmind.  Instead they do it because they want to.  Every day millions of\\npeople read the stuff on the Internet and they learn then the remix and\\nreuse the stuff and produce other stuff that helps other people learn. \\nWow.  They don't always have clear objectives in mind, but with a\\nlittle effort the knowledge gained improves their lives. </p>\\n<p>Welcome to learning objects 2.0.  The ones that actually work.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2005-11-22-i-have-changed/index.md absPath of file >>>

and\\ncontext.  In the mean time I have also been reading some of Dumbing Us\\nDown by John Gatto.  In order for learning object to be reused some\\neffort must be made to remove the\\ncontext from learning objects.  Gatto's criticizis the move to\\nremove learning from its original context and his ideas have had an\\neffect on me.  Learning\\nobject proponents would argue that you remove the context from the\\nobject so that it is more reusable, but that removing context is fine\\nsince before the instruction is finished you go back and wrap the\\nobjects in context.  I would argue that for some objects the context is\\nthe learning and that by removing the context you remove all that is\\nvaluable from the object.</p>\\n<p>The result of this thinking has altered my view of how we assemble\\ninstruction. I agree that some objects are useful on their own.  An\\nimage can be reused in multiple instances.  Sometimes a math problem\\ncan be reused easily. What about an article on the web? I would argue\\nthat the article itself contains context.</p>\\n<p>Both components constitute the learning experience, but\\nthe point is that the objects themselves lack context.  I think it is\\nmore complex.  Some objects are useful on their own.  However, many\\nobjects require the context that they were generated in to make sense,\\nand still other digital objects are kind of useful but only if you can\\ntake them apart and reuse parts of them.  It might be true that in an\\nideal setting all objects would be labeled with all kinds of meta data\\nthat would then let some really fancy computer software build\\ncustomized instruction at the learner's whim.  However, the more\\npractical solution is development of new learning materials using\\nexisting objects ie the billions of web pages, images, flash files,\\nbits of source code, applets, pdfs, etc.</p>\\n<p>Reusing these objects is kind of like building a house or a car or some\\nreal object.  You buy the tires for the car, the chips for the\\nelectronics, you get the glass from another supplier and so on.  You be\\nable to buy sheet metal but it doesn't look like a car so you will need\\nto rework it.  This will produce some waste.  In an ideal world you\\ncould just get the exact piece you need for the front fender but it\\nisn't going to happen anytime soon.  Other parts you will make from\\nscratch yourself.  You might have an in-house group that forges the\\nengine block etc.  At any rate the finished product works great or at\\nleast it works good for some specific purpose.  Sports cars don't work\\nif you need to haul the family around and you probably don't want to\\nhaul dirt in the back seat of your Cadillac.</p>\\n<p>Instruction isn't all that different.  The end product might be built\\nfrom some objects and some raw material.  Some of it you will have to\\nbuild yourself.  Sometimes you will try to reuse someone elses\\ninstruction and find that you have to throw away a lot of it to make it\\nfit.  That is OK.  Whatever you do you better make sure that the\\ninstruction that you end up with is well suited for the specific task\\nand that it is effective at what it does.  It might be a Ferrari, but\\nif it needs to carry the family you have failed.</p>\",\"id\":\"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2005-11-04-learning-is-more-about-assembling-raw-materials-than-about-objects/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"templateKey\":\"blog-post\",\"path\":\"/learning-is-more-about-assembling-raw-materials-than-about-objects\",\"date\":\"2005-11-04T07:00:00Z\",\"title\":\"Learning is more about assembling raw materials than about objects\",\"imageUrl\":null,\"structuredHtml\":null,\"image\":null}}},{\"node\":{\"excerpt\":\"I have been reading through more of  Dave Wiley's learning objects text book  so\\nthat I can claim to be doing something vaguely academic.  I'll\\nwrite more about learning objects and how I don't think they are all\\nthat useful in a bit, but in the mean time my brain is off on another\\ntangent.  I have been thinking more about the educational system\\nand instruction in general.  Throw into that mix the…\",\"html\":\"<p>I have been reading through more of <a href=\\\"http://opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Conversations_About_Learning_Objects\\\">Dave Wiley's learning objects text book </a>so\\nthat I can claim to be doing something vaguely academic.  I'll\\nwrite more about learning objects and how I don't think they are all\\nthat useful in a bit, but in the mean time my brain is off on another\\ntangent.  I have been thinking more about the educational system\\nand instruction in general.  Throw into that mix the fact that I\\nam a student and then add in my generally lazy/rebelious/I don't give a\\n***| attitude and you get an argument about why we need to have\\nobjects.  I got thinking about why it is that we are required to\\nachieve certain goals in our education.  The teacher gives an\\nassigment -
