I shuddered and it wasn\'t from the cold. However, I listened to the broadcast anyway despite my disgust at hearing that our government was now being tagged with version labels. (Shouldn\'t we be on something more like government 232.0 or something anyway?)</p>\n<p>Yes there is a point.</p>\n<p>Utah in spite of being non-progressive in politics is very progressive in using technology to help facilitate the political process. They have computers and email. (One senator from Cache Valley is quoted as saying he would use his as a step ladder to help him get up on his horse - true story.)</p>\n<p>Luckily they have moved a step further. <a href="http://www.senatesite.com/senatesight.html"> The Senate has a webcam</a> and a <a href="http://www.senatesite.com/blog/">Senate blog</a>. It is my understanding however that only the majority posts to it so that excludes a democrat that somehow got elected - I am sure they will do away with that guy somehow.</p>\n<p>You can listen to <a href="http://www.senatesite.com/senateradio.php">Senate radio</a>. (Who needs to still music anymore when you have the Senate to listen to. Watch out Black Eyed Peas the Senate is going to take you down.</p>\n<p>The 2.0 part comes from the most exciting development. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/utahsenatechannel">The Utah Senate has a Youtube channel.</a> and they are now accepting texts and will send out a daily text to anyone that wants to keep up with the goings on in Utah.</p>\n<p>The 2.0 label is overused and lame, but it is very cool that here in Utah the government is moving to greater levels of transparency and that they are attempting to get information out to citizens as quickly as possible. Normally I complain about government but in this case these guys are doing the right thing.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Government 2.0",date:"January 09, 2008",imageUrl:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/government-20"}}}});
