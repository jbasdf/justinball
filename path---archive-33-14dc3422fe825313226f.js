sheetrock.  What is hard is all the\nlittle details that one learns only from experience and from hanging\naround a bunch of guys that usually smoke a lot of pot, but that are\nreally good with their hands.  The last time I did anything - put\nin a sprinkler system and built a huge deck - I spent months with my\nbrother (both of us are engineers) figuring out all the details. \nWe made specific plans.  We calculated loads, water\npressure.  We did it all.  You know what?  My wife still\ngives me crap about that.  For all of our upfront planning we\nstill didn't do any better than the guys that smoke all that pot.</p>\n<p>Why should you care?</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago I <a href=\"http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail571.html\">listened</a> to a <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/wlg/6913\">lecture</a> given by <a href=\"http://www.adambosworth.net/\">Adam Bosworth</a> at\nthe recent Mysql conference, and a week ago I had the chance to attend\na <a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/archive/2005/09/07/14562.aspx\">presentation</a> given by <a href=\"http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/default.aspx\">Aaron Skonnard</a> on the upcoming features in\nIndigo/Windows something or other services.  I have also been\nreading through Wiley's book on learning objects as well as perusing\nlesscode.org.  I find the debate between simple and complex,\nupfront and just in time design everywhere.   Simple designs\nallow more individuals to participate.  HTML is popular because it\nis easy to use and does not require an advanced degree to\nunderstand.  Bosworth talked about the importance of RSS and how\nit is the html for data.  I agree.  It is simple and\neasy.  It lets many people participate.  When I was at the\nlecture given by Skonnard he asked what eBay, Google and Amazon use for\ndata exchange.  I said RSS (you can see it <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/xs/syndicate.html/104-2426989-4309567\">here</a>). \nEveryone laughed, but I wasn't kidding.  Skonnard's lecture was\naimed at a group of individuals for whom it is important to have lots\nof layer that contain security, and interop, and bla bla bla. \nLots of stuff.  Yes, in that realm all those layers are\nimportant.  For the few that build systems that get stock quote or\nweather reports (the archetype web service applications) I am sure that\nall that stuff is important.  However, all that code will just\ndrown the rest of us.  Here's something that will surprise you,\nengineers don't like to read docs.  They like to code.  If\nthey liked to read/write docs they would be english majors.  I\nadmit to having read a couple of rfcs in my life.  They\nsuck.  You have to consume unhealthy amounts of caffeine to keep\nyour eyes open.  Guess what.  The longer the docs are, the\nmore training sessions you have to go to, the fewer people there are\nthat will use your stuff.  That's just how it is.</p>\n<p>Did I mention that Indigo won't ship for a year and since it is M$ it\nprobably won't show up for a few years and it will have been re-branded\nseveral times.  The big company way is lots of code, lots of\nlayers, lots of stuff to make hard things really hard.  That way\nthey can keep out the small guys who can't afford to pay for all the\ntesting and the interop conferences and deal with all the support\nrequired to keep all those layers running.  I won't say that such\nsystems are never needed.  They are.  If you are building\nskyscrapers or bridges or big expensive things then you need a bunch of\nengineers with plans and designs and stuff.  If you are finishing\nyour basement, putting in a sprinkler system, or building a deck then\nsmoke all the pot you want and you can probably still get it right\nwithout all the complex design.  Most of us are finishing\nbasements not building skyscrapers.</p>\n<p>So does this have anything to do with learning objects? \nYup.  It does.  In my previous life I worked on an LMS. \nI never read the SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model or is\nit Stupid Crappy Overly Retarded Mess) docs.  I doubt anyone has\nread them all.  No one likes to do data entry so all those IEEE\nmetadata fields will never be filled out.  There are a couple of\ncompanies, probably paid by the DOD that will build SCORM compliant\nsystems.  I think they do it as a weapon.  To heck with\nencryption, just make your stuff SCORM compliant no one will ever be\nable to figure it out.</p>\n<p>More later, I have to go work on my basement.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2005-09-15-this-shouldnt-be-so-amp-hard/index.md absPath of file >>>
