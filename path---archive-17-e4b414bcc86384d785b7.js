Like the Earth\'s anus this place belches the nastiest gas you have ever smelled. The girls love it, but hold their noses a lot. I am good with it except for the terrifying narrow roads with the sheer drops seeking to plummet you to your death. There are a lot of animals too. Big ones. I guess that is to be expected. When I was in high school I used to bring dates up here. I got stuck in a herd of 300 buffalo and nearly missed our show at Pierre\'s Playhouse. I wonder if that place is still around. My dad doesn\'t know, but that was the same day that I had a park ranger pull up while I and said date were picnicking and tell me there they had had reports of a red car a lot like mine flying past obnoxious RVs at 100mph which was very illegal in the park.</p>\n<p>I had (and still have) no idea what he was talking about. Luckily my brother destroyed any evidence a few years later by slamming it into a concrete wall.</p>\n<p>Park rangers tend to be annoying people that can\'t get actual jobs. They tend to think everyone else has absolutely no right to visit their park and for all they care the general populous can just die (which is why they design the roads here they way they do and then put up abstract road signs like "danger ahead", "just drive off the road and die" or "debris on road" which means there is a boulder up here perched such that if anyone sneezes it will crush you and your atomic family. I made one of those up. My favorite sign is "Rough Break Ahead". It\'s kind of like a fortune cookie from a bad Chinese restaurant. It also describes my life.</p>\n<p>I met one of these park rangers this morning. I bet he was from the east coast, works at an investment firm and thinks he can spend the summer in Yellowstone and save the wolves or something. My daughters love maps. I requested 4. One for us so that we can navigate the park and three for the girls. He gives me this "why do you need four maps." I wanted to say, "we ran out of toilet paper and I need to wipe my ass," but instead I politely explained that my girls love maps and they learn from them, bla bla. He says, "I\'ll give you three." I wanted to say, "I think you failed math," but instead I thanked him. Then he gave me a park newsletter and explained that I should review the park rules and regulations with my family and that they can be found on page 2. I grew up a bit more than an hour from the park. This is my backyard. I would have loved to describe to him interesting uses of page 2, but instead I smiled and drove on to the Walmart of Yellowstone, Old Faithful.</p>\n<p>Everyone goes there. We must go there too.</p>\n<p>Its hard to describe the area anymore. There are more lodges here than hotels on the strip in Las Vegas. The parking lot reminds me of Walmart at Christmas. The company that runs the lodges and restaurants in the park imports employees from around the world. That makes your national park experience \'multi-cultural.\' In fact it means \'cheap labor\'. The poor guy helping me out had a heck of a time getting hot dogs and macaroni and cheese for my kids. We can barely understand the kids sometimes. Some guy from rural China has no chance.</p>\n<p>I think the kids had fun today. Jenna is fascinated by the animals and constantly asks about where they live and can she see them. When she doesn\'t see actual animals she looks for signs of animals which are plentiful around the various park features:\n"What poop is that?"\n"That\'s elk poop Jenna"\n"What about that poop?"\n"That\'s buffalo poop Jenna."\n"What about that poop."\n"That\'s elk poop Jenna."\n"What about that?"\n"That\'s where daddy used page 2 ..."</p>\n\n  <a class="gatsby-resp-image-link" href="/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-fc46b.jpg" style="display: block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">\n  \n  <span class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper" style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">\n    <span class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image" style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;">\n      <img class="gatsby-resp-image-image" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;" alt="Bear in Yellowstone" title="" src="/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-b80fa.jpg" srcset="/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-cf410.jpg 163w,\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-62f2a.jpg 325w,\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-b80fa.jpg 650w,\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-08cb4.jpg 975w,\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-f2bf9.jpg 1300w,\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-fd4ba.jpg 1950w,\n/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-fc46b.jpg 3888w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    ',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-27-yellowstone/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/yellowstone",date:"2008-06-27T06:00:00Z",title:"Yellowstone",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Family","Fun Stuff","Jenna","family trip","Jenna","yellowstone"],image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/bear-a5e04af55f5e8f3637bd9037b4265736-381d6.jpg"}}}}}},{node:{excerpt:"Last year for  our open ed conference here at Utah State  I built an application called  51weeks  to help preserve the presentations and to help people interact.

Tomorrow it will be used at ICLS in the Netherlands. The hardest part about these kinds of applications is life cycle management. I am frequently asked to build a \'quick and dirty\' application. Years of experience has taught me that there is no such thing. Anytime you are asked to build an application you are being asked to commit to keep it alive. What inevitably happens is that someone sees it and assumes that it only needs a few tweaks to adapt it to a new use. If your code is to dirty then forget it. Adaptation almost always runs you into new errors that you have to deal with in new ways.</p>\n<p>Whenever creating an application it is always worth the time to get tests in place. It is always worth the time to think about the architecture - not the architecture for the entire system - but rather the big picture. How will the application be deployed? What services will it depend on? What happens when the code becomes obsolete and needs to updated? This is a very real issue with Rails. Methods are deprecated or changed and plugins stop working. I know that most people like to believe that once an application is done it is done. This is a terrible fallacy. Every application requires attention to manage bugs, growth, obsolescence.</p>\n<p>Every time I am asked to bring up an old application I am reminded of these issues. Best of luck and enjoy the application to all 51weeks users at ICLS.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-24-51weeks-at-icls/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/51weeks-at-icls",date:"2008-06-24T06:00:00Z",title:"51Weeks at ICLS",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Programming","Ruby On Rails","51weeks","icls2008","Ruby On Rails"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"One of my favorite rides is Blacksmith Fork Canyon.

After years of promising my wife we would go on vacation to Disneyland with the kids, we finally made it. Some people make this trek frequently - one of Callie's mom's friends goes 4 times a year.</p>\n<p>That's a bit too happy for me.</p>\n<p>I had been to Disneyland once before. I was in high school and our jazz band performed there. Afterwards they gave us a food voucher and admittance for one day. I think I rode two rides and searched high and low for a place that would take the food voucher. If I remember correctly, I went hungry because we couldn't find anywhere cheap enough to use the food voucher.</p>\n<p>Disneyland is the 'happiest place on earth'. They go to great lengths to make that fact true. If you so much as drop a candy wrapper or sneeze there is a team on site, dressed in white and looking cheery, to ensure that mess is cleaned up within nano seconds. There aren't even any bugs around. Not sure how they pull that off and I'm not sure I want to know.</p>\n<p>During my time in college, I stood in some long lines. These were to pay tuition or to get into a class. They were nothing compared to the happiest lines on earth. Disneyland is a place where you spend the majority of 3 days standing in line for the opportunity to ride for a few minutes. Wait time to play time is somewhere in the range of 1 hour riding to 24 hours waiting. At least they make it a happy wait time, you are usually in the shade and frequently surrounded by something that is spinning, blinking or talking. If that isn't entertaining enough then you can just look around. The characters attending Disneyland are as amusing as Mickey and sometimes as scary as Maleficent. I didn't really feel like I could let go of my kids hands very often. I don't love large crowds, and I am pretty sure if your kids managed to get very far away from you they would be lost forever. Although I didn't notice security people stationed around and I am sure they would help you out with a smile. Of course, if you broke down into tears they would quickly whisk you away to a happy place so you didn't spoil anyone else's happiness.</p>\n<p>We went to the Haunted House first. This was to be my daughter's very first experience with Disneyland. Aubrey left the place in tears. I was pretty sure they were done with Disney at that point. To really make them hate life we took them on Splash Mountain next. Aubrey didn't trust us much after that. Maybe with a lot of therapy sometime around college graduation she will love us again. After those rides we stuck pretty much with Pooh Bear, the Tea Cups, Alice in Wonderland and Astroblasters (a Buzz Lightyear thing). Of all the rides the girls liked the Astroblasters the best. We rode it 5 times. That gets boring, but they loved it. I don't get why there are older people on some of these rides. Seriously people, after they age of 12 or so why are you standing in line to ride Alice or Astroblasters or Pooh Bear if you don't have kids? I don't get that, but then I probably wouldn't be at Disneyland if I didn't have kids. I would be in Moab or Europe or in bed. I think I would probably be in bed. That would be an awesome vacation. Disneyland makes you very tired.</p>\n<p>The girls loved the Tea Cups. They were very funny on that ride and surprisingly I didn't puke even though I rode it quite a few times. They were terrified of the Story Book ride because you float into the mouth of a toothy whale. (Whales don't have teeth, what is Disney teaching our kids?) We rode it once and then they wanted to go over and over. The lines to Snow White and Pinocchio were short so we rode those. They are the same ride with different disturbing images from a couple of pretty creepy movies. I'm still glad the lines were short.</p>\n<p>We rode on Mr Toad's wild ride which is just like the Snow White and Pinocchio rides except that at the end you go to hell and it is very hot. I guess I need to do some research. Maybe the ride should be called Mr Toad goes to hell don't ride this when it is hot outside.</p>\n<p>Aubrey desperately wanted to ride Peter Pan so we stood in line for 4 hours (45 minutes, but it feels like 4 hours). That ride is a bit more interesting than they previous 3 simply because you fly in a ship over lots of Christmas lights that look like stars. The girls loved it. I say they can put up the Christmas lights next year and hang off a ladder while reaching for the next hook. The adrenaline rush is similar and you still get to see Christmas light stars.</p>\n<p>Its too bad Jenna wasn't taller. She was brave and up for pretty much anything but the height restrictions kept her of a few things. We went to California Adventure. They have a Brother Bear tree house, hike, wilderness area where you walk around on ropes and feel like you are in the woods (as opposed to going to the actual forrest). They do a tire swing (jumper training I think they call it.) They wouldn't let Jenna ride because she was an inch to short. They will let her ride on roller coasters, but heaven forbid she swing from a tire six inches off the ground. She cried. In Toon Town I stood in line with all the girls for 30 minutes only to have Aubrey and Alyssa refuse to get on at the last second. Jenna rode it with Leslie. At the end Dave and Leslie said she was lit like a candle. We might have to come back someday just to let her ride some of the more thrilling rides.</p>\n<p>I paid the most I have ever paid for a meal at Ariel's grotto. It was a Disney princess breakfast. The girls loved it. It was a good meal and I didn't have to stand in line or haul food around. It was worth it for those last two facts and hey the girls got buttons. We took the girls to the Bug's Life rides. Aubrey got to ride bumper cars there (that go .00001 mph). They wouldn't let Devin ride. Pirates of the Caribbean is fine, but Grandma's Florida bumper car experience is to dangerous.</p>\n<p>We did make it to Soaring over California which is a cool experience. They freak you out by buckling you and hauling you ten feet off the ground. It successfully freaked Alyssa out. She cried through most of it, but the visual effect is impressive. They even spray smelly stuff in the air so when you fly over an orange grove its kind of like replacing those little tree things in your car. Very special.</p>\n<p>All the kids loved the Carousel which was great because that line is short. If you want to ride Pirates of the Caribbean go during Fantasmic because you will be pretty much the only one on the ride. If you are going to eat in the park which you may as well do because leaving means walking a long ways then there is a Mexican place which isn't to bad and the New Orleans area is decent. Downtown Disney has some places we walked by that smell nice and California Adventure has nice restaurants (the food at Ariel's Grotto was good). Expect to pay somewhere around what you make in a month for food. It really isn't cheap, but at least you will be happy to give them your money because after all it is the Happiest Place on Earth.</p>\n<p>Before I forget here's a time breakdown:\nStanding in line 5 hours\nRiding rides 1 hour\nShopping 6 hours\nFiguring out where to go next 8 hours\nWalking 100 hours (ok 10 hours or so, but if feels like 100. My feet still hurt)\nUsing the happiest bathrooms on earth 4 hours.\nThere were shows, fireworks and characters mixed in there as well.</p>\n<p>I and my wife had fun but more important my kids had a really great time.</p>\n<p>I guess we are happy now.</p>",id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-06-02-im-just-so-happy/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/im-just-so-happy",date:"2008-06-02T06:00:00Z",title:"I&#8217;m Just so Happy",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["kids","disneyland","happy"],image:null}}},{node:{excerpt:'I wrote this on May 11th but never got around to posting it: We took the kids to Thanksgiving Point yesterday to look at the gardens.

Who says following the crowd doesn\'t work? We made it to the mall just before closing.\nAll the kids needed to use the facilities at that point so at 10 at night we hauled all the kids into the store so they could pee. As we stepped in the front door our quest\nwas almost over before it started. Right as we walked in the front door there was a sign that said \'Restrooms\'. We started walking down the short hall but there were only two doors\nand neither looked like a restroom. The arrow pointing towards relief was aimed downward. We assumed that the arrow had been turned somehow and that the restrooms were somewhere close.\nWe walked through the store and ran into a salesman he haughtily told us, "they are downstairs." I said, "that\'s good because the sign back there made me wonder if we were supposed to pee on the floor."

Then I called Joel and said let\'s go for a ride. He was good with the idea so we headed towards Black Smith Fork Canyon. This is one of my favorite rides. It is a reasonable evening ride - a 42 mile loop from my house. It is also a great section to throw onto a longer Saturday ride.</p>\n<p>Given that I had a lot going on and that it was my first ride of the season I was going to be lazy and stop at the end of Old Hollow Road which isn\'t really that far from my house. When we go to the end of Old Hollow Road we decided that we were feeling pretty good so we kept going to the power plant which is not quite half way up the canyon. We still felt good so to the top of the canyon we went. That was a great time. I felt great. The scenery was beautiful - there was still snow on the mountains up there so it was also cold.</p>\n<p>Black Smith Fork is a tricky canyon. You push on the way up because it is uphill, but you assume that coming back will be easy because it is downhill. If you assume that you\'re a damn fool. The still air on the way up and the ease at which you ascend is the first sign that something is not right. After you revel in your accomplishment at the top you face the wind the entire way back down the canyon. I know this. I have had ridden this canyon many times and yet I ignore the facts that have been emblazoned into my brain from every ride before. However, the scenery is addictive. Like a Black Widow louring and then devouring her mate Black Smith Fork will draw you to the top and then sap the life out of you on the way back. Typically only divorce lawyers are so skilled and cold hearted.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.justinball.com/2007/08/08/rode-blacksmith-fork-canyon-tonight/">The last time I did this ride without sufficient nutrition I bonked</a> and I told myself that I had learned my lesson. I guess I have to relearn that lesson once a year. My skipping of lunch and dependence on two 90 calorie granola bars resulted in a painful bonk again towards the end. It wasn\'t as bad this time. I didn\'t go nuts like the time before, but the million little bugs gnawing the muscle off my leg bones told me I had depleted all my energy reserves.</p>\n<p>Lycra isn\'t an especially good insulator. I did have the sense to put on a smart wool base layer and some full finger gloves, but other than that it was pretty much me against the 40 degree weather. I don\'t like to get to hot so I typically under dress. After a while I figured I could probably cut off my toes and eat them for sustenance if required. I couldn\'t feel them anyway. When I did make it home it took three hours to warm back up in spite of a hot shower. The snow on the hills around us should have been a clue.</p>\n<p>I blame it on the bike.</p>\n<p>I have a brand new 2008 Trek Madone 6.9. To me there isn\'t a sweeter bike. It is a beautiful bike - a piece of art. Every time I find myself in the garage I have to stare at it or touch it. It calls to me and begs to be ridden. I am disgusting. I love that bike.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-047-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">This bike begs to be ridden</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9289.jpg"><img src="img_9289-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">Up close</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-041-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Other side</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Back to the ride. The hills were non-existent. The pavement smoothed by the carbon frame, my back didn\'t exhibit its usual total break down that results in my inability to stand up for days. The Bontrager XXX Lite wheels are so light and smooth that you barely notice they are there at all. They spin up fast and roll like butter on a hot grill.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9286.jpg"><img src="img_9286-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">Carbon is Nice</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-052-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">These are light as air</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It took me a while to decide on whether to go with SRAM Red or Dura Ace. I thought I might regret the Dura Ace, but it is silky smooth. My last bike with Shimano 105 had a hard time. Shifting the front ring was like playing BlackJack. You had about a 49% chance of it actually working. I almost died once because when I tried to shift it failed and dropped the chain while I was crossing a road. I am sure the oncoming truck was a little surprised and probably ticked when I jumped off the bike and ran across the road just in time to miss becoming road kill. I don\'t even notice the shift now. This is especially encouraging because I wasn\'t a fan of the Race X Lite crank at first. I am sure it isn\'t the stiffest but it is dependable and smooth.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-048-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Not so bad after all</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-035-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Silky smooth as ever</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-056-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">You won\'t even notice the shift on the front rings</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The frame cannot be beat. I have it hanging on the wall in my garage next to my Santa Cruz Blur XC.\nThat is my kind of art gallery. If it wasn\'t so much more fun to ride the bikes I could just sit there and stare at them all day. The paint job is sweet. Next to my wife it is the sexiest thing I have seen. (Thanks for letting me buy the new bike dear).</p>\n<p>I have a bad back - degenerated disk - so for me a comfy ride has to take priority over a super stiff frame. Don\'t take that to mean the frame isn\'t stiff. It is and it responds well. It smooths out the nasty bumps in the road but is still there for me when I stand up to pound on the pedals. The road noise that was uncomfortable on my aluminum bike turns into a hum that keeps you connected to the pavement without vibrating you to death.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-037-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">The seat mast helps to stiffen the frame but still provides a comfortable ride</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9290.jpg"><img src="img_9290-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-054-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>On my previous bike I was always a bit nervous to look behind me as I had a hard time keeping the bike going straight. I feel more comfortable on this bike. It likes to go straight even though I am not great at maintaining a straight line. You don\'t think about corners. The bike glides around them in a controlled smooth line. When you look at the spokes on the Race XXX Lite wheels you\'d think you\'d snap them if you weigh more than a teenage girl but they hold up just fine and in fact aren\'t mushy at all. I was worried I\'d feel them sloshing back and forth against the brake pads if I stood up to pound on the pedals but nothing of the sort happened. For reference I weight between 170 and 175 depending on the time of day.</p>\n<p>There are a few downsides to the bike. I thought that the Race X Lite crank would be one, but as it turns out it works just fine. If Dura Ace made a compact crank I would demand that, but Shimano is late to that party. The big downside? The literature states that it comes with the SRAM 1090 Powerdome cassette, but when I pulled the bike out of the box at the shop it was wearing the 1070 cassette. I had the shop call Trek. Their reply was that the specs are subject to change anytime, we couldn\'t get them so sorry you\'re screwed. I find it odd that there seem to be plenty available on eBay and Specialized managed to find some for their new Tarmac SL2. Astana is running SRAM Red so you\'d think some kind of inside deal would be possible. The largest bike company in the world with a team sponsorship couldn\'t get them? Also notice that they didn\'t lower the price a corresponding amount. Trek gets a big fat F here. This was the big disappointment in an otherwise perfect experience.</p>\n<p>The only other downside is minor and probably common to most bikes. Some of the decals are not especially clean. I see a few jagged edges here and there. You\'ll have to click through to the large picture on the seat post joint to even notice. I guess that might be one argument for Project One - there are no decals everything is painted on.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-050-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">The 1070 cassette should have been a 1090</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-057-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">&nbsp;</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I had the shop install my Polar CS600 on the bike. The guys at the shop told me that the power unit wouldn\'t quite fit when in the small front ring and the bottom three rings on the back without the chain running right on top of the sensor. Turns out they were wrong. (They also never finished installing all the sensors but still charged me full price.) The powerful magnet pulls the chain down when there is any slack but pedaling shows that there is plenty of clearance. I was a bit freaked out at first since I was worried my nice computer wouldn\'t work with my nice bike but it runs out that everything is fine.</p>\n<div class="image-grid">\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <a href="img_9284.jpg"><img src="img_9284-300x225.jpg" /></a>\n    <p class="caption">The Polar CS600 unit fits just fine</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-053-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Polar CS600 Computer on the bars</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class="post-images">\n    <img src="picture-055-300x225.jpg" />\n    <p class="caption">Polar CS600 Computer on the bars</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Even after spending a year doing research and saving money I was nervous about spending a small fortune on a bicycle. If you view it as a bike that is worth than my truck then you might need to be treated for hyperventilation. The retail on this bike with tax will take you north of $8k. However, where I live plenty of people have several four wheelers or motor bikes in their garage. Others have camp trailers or jet skis. Even I have an old motor bike. I use it once a year. Most of the people around me are probably in the same situation with their toys. Here\'s the thing - I ride my bike everyday. Since I have started riding I have dropped 30 lbs and I no longer breath heavy when I climb a flight of stairs. Sure a cheaper bike would do the same thing, but if you just can\'t resist and you can scrape together the cash you won\'t regret parking one of these in the garage.</p>',id:"/Users/jbasdf/projects/justinball/src/posts/2008-04-29-first-real-ride-on-the-new-trek-madone-69/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{templateKey:"blog-post",path:"/first-real-ride-on-the-new-trek-madone-69",date:"2008-04-29T06:00:00Z",title:"First Real Ride on the New Trek Madone 6.9",imageUrl:null,structuredHtml:null,tags:["Cycling","2008 trek madone 6.9","6.9","BlackSmith Fork Canyon","Cycling","madone","polar cs600","review","trek"],image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{src:"/static/picture-047-f44d8d648e1e77c3db38445b06677354-381d6.jpg"}}}}}},{node:{excerpt:"The next time you take a bite out of that yummy loaf of bread consider where it came from.
